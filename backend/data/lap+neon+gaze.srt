1
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:12,465
The

2
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:21,225
first click,

3
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,190
I think I'm actually in though.

4
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,340
Can I?

5
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:29,700
Feels good.

6
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,330
Perfect.

7
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,630
Yeah.

8
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:35,700
Okay.

9
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,510
What you wanna put a little more, make sure it drops.

10
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:51,900
leah: Yeah.

11
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,230
Nice.

12
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,500
Okay.

13
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,760
We'll take gas on please.

14
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,090
Yes.

15
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,500
Low.

16
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,920
Okay.

17
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,900
Opening pressure six.

18
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,760
Perfect.

19
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,180
We can go.

20
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,125
Well, we're already on high flow.

21
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,730
We can get high flow or three.

22
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,965
I mean, even though the vari doesn't do anything limited by our instrument, we are insufflating.

23
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:19,925
leah: Okay.

24
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,440
Let's white balance our little guy.

25
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,000
Wait,

26
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:25,320
leah: what'd you say?

27
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,050
Oh, it's in the white balance

28
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,530
leah: Fail.

29
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,125
Usually you can white balance.

30
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:30,390
Are you where

31
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,140
all the monitors are?

32
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:31,765
Yeah.

33
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,970
Yeah, because I've got one right there.

34
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,150
Leah.

35
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,020
Is our light on?

36
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,500
So our camera

37
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,650
leah: on?

38
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,820
Is it on?

39
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,210
Nope.

40
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,600
leah: Nope.

41
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,190
Can we get the, um, the light on

42
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,360
looking at you?

43
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,770
I think right here you see where you can turn the light on.

44
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,250
Go down.

45
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,360
leah: I see.

46
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,120
And click your first one.

47
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,420
Oh.

48
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:58,740
leah: There isn't

49
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:58,829
it?

50
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:59,370
Beautiful

51
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,010
Turn back.

52
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,569
You can do that too.

53
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:21,344
leah: Thanks.

54
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:21,865
Okay.

55
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,430
I hate pressing all those damn buttons.

56
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,185
I just don't know why they just themselves over there.

57
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:26,665
Okay.

58
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:28,745
God damn.

59
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:29,824
So annoying.

60
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:32,385
Thanks.

61
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,110
So

62
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:37,650
now

63
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:39,990
big

64
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:40,770
leah: stick back there.

65
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:42,810
Rock.

66
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:44,185
Okay.

67
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,050
Just want somebody to just get it off this.

68
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:46,711
There we go.

69
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,959
Okay, here we go.

70
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,069
No, totally small things.

71
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:53,930
There is.

72
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:54,860
Yeah.

73
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,380
leah: I just find that camera navigation system annoying.

74
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,360
Okay.

75
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,400
Almost there.

76
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,420
One more.

77
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,356
I'll take the Optive view.

78
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,074
Yeah, she's up to 15, 14.

79
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:07,555
Thank you.

80
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,650
leah: He likes it.

81
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,819
How does he like it again?

82
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,140
No, I mean, just where he likes the, to see everything.

83
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,650
See if that's okay.

84
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:34,460
Take this out here.

85
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,030
Yeah.

86
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:51,535
Okay.

87
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:55,725
leah: Let him know if you need that down or anything.

88
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:59,625
Or if you're good, you may need to focus a hair.

89
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:04,485
Yeah.

90
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:05,805
Nice.

91
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:11,745
Yeah.

92
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:12,615
Lots of twisting.

93
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,100
Nice.

94
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:19,699
brian: Okay.

95
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:31,880
leah: All right.

96
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:33,135
Nice.

97
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:34,095
You can drop your angle.

98
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:35,265
Yeah.

99
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:35,685
Perfect.

100
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,005
Okay.

101
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,310
Real quick.

102
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,230
Open up.

103
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,670
Perfect.

104
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:49,545
leah: All right.

105
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:52,390
Let's take a little pickaroo peek.

106
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,975
Actually clean this and then I'll take this, please.

107
00:15:58,905 --> 00:15:58,995
Mm-hmm.

108
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,360
Thank you

109
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:06,800
two.

110
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,200
Thank you.

111
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:14,925
leah: Alright.

112
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:18,915
And just look straight down, check everything, make sure no injury.

113
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:20,625
Nice.

114
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,635
We didn't insulate any momentum.

115
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:23,325
Beautiful.

116
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:27,615
Yeah.

117
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:28,245
Check everything.

118
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:28,575
I love it.

119
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:33,855
Okay.

120
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,300
Or traits with the

121
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,310
leah: Yeah, it's fine.

122
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,000
Okay.

123
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:44,560
All right.

124
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:50,439
Given her, I was gonna do, um, super umbilical for our next port.

125
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,090
This will be another five.

126
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:01,275
Okay, this.

127
00:17:01,564 --> 00:17:02,074
Thank you.

128
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:08,450
Not like a 15.

129
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:12,034
Okay.

130
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,010
A little bit bigger, the elevens.

131
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:16,915
It's okay.

132
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,274
Do you want an elevens?

133
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,409
No.

134
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:18,829
Totally fine.

135
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:20,540
Alrighty.

136
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:38,090
Okay, now, right now let's switch our camera here to the ambo port, and then we'll do our epigastric port.

137
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,030
That'll be our big one.

138
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:41,540
Yep.

139
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,620
leah: What do we have?

140
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,490
We have an 11 or 12.

141
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,290
Do you wanna go to the, and we're gonna go like, um, so I think that's to the right of the, our policy.

142
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,500
Yeah.

143
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,700
leah: I usually try to Google kind of through it.

144
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,899
And I feel like for this you can never be like, I mean you can, but you can never really be too high.

145
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:59,570
So I just think a little bit higher than you expect and then
come through and then angle through FCI towards gallbladder,

146
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,830
but kind of like coming.

147
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,810
Can I see the other side of fie real quick?

148
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,791
Just because I know.

149
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:09,115
Dr. George when we went in last time too, you said it kind of angled almost come like a gray.

150
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:09,804
Yeah, exactly.

151
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:14,845
Crot like, like the, almost like the crotch over the fsy hangs down.

152
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,754
So I'll take a, um, find your needle real quick.

153
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,335
leah: I feel like she's like catty

154
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:22,465
head,

155
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:26,965
so I think you're a little too low.

156
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:26,995
Okay.

157
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:27,955
Yeah.

158
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:29,125
So you wanna come up higher?

159
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:29,155
Okay.

160
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:32,365
But you wanna come through here and then angle through that side.

161
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:32,919
Okay.

162
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,240
Yeah.

163
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:46,955
You might not be able to see it.

164
00:18:46,955 --> 00:18:47,735
You might be going through FAU

165
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:53,705
brian: can remember, but I think you're going mark to the skin.

166
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,385
Remember, so you have landmarks for yourself.

167
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:56,165
Okay.

168
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:56,794
It's easier.

169
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:57,544
I'm too lateral.

170
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,570
It's just a, A small pearl.

171
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,254
Yeah, just wherever you mark it, it's okay.

172
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,635
But draw some landmarks for yourself.

173
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:05,554
This is xiphoid right here.

174
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:11,705
You wanting to be just a little bit up here and then almost like,

175
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,825
leah: so I actually don't think that's xiphoid, that's why I think you're off midline.

176
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:15,514
Xiphos here.

177
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,889
Yeah,

178
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,385
OIDs here.

179
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,685
We still want to go like medial to fallacy

180
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:26,105
leah: or Yeah.

181
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:31,595
I would go like, you could go like right here and then when you put your
port in, you'll come down and then you'll angle through fallacy that way.

182
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:31,804
Okay.

183
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,605
brian: Draw a big line, three hash marks on it.

184
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:34,415
Remember?

185
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:34,985
Yep.

186
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:37,145
brian: That'll be fine.

187
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:37,655
Yep.

188
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:40,294
And then you use that as a reference when you're doing your needle there.

189
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:41,675
You'll know where you're at when make a decision.

190
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:41,975
Okay.

191
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,680
Something I'm like, it's weird 'cause I, there you're, yeah, this is kind of actually where I wanted to come out.

192
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,280
Like right there.

193
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,200
leah: Yeah.

194
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,890
Right on that side of f.

195
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,305
In what size is this port again?

196
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:42,295
This is gonna be, we're first gonna put in a five then no or no?

197
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:43,520
11. 11. Just, yeah.

198
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:43,885
I was just asking.

199
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:44,485
leah: 11 or 12.

200
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:44,665
Yeah.

201
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:45,175
Okay.

202
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:45,505
Sorry.

203
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:46,135
leah: No, you're good.

204
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:47,305
I was asking Fine.

205
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:55,280
brian: We should talk about skin incisions at some point.

206
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:55,680
Okay.

207
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,445
That massive hemorrhage is avoidable.

208
00:20:58,285 --> 00:20:58,315
Okay.

209
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,715
leah: Remind problem

210
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:07,015
and then, yeah, just watch.

211
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,065
So you don't Skype too much.

212
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:10,405
I usually try to come and, and then turn angle.

213
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:12,025
brian: Every angle you actually have a finder needle angle.

214
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,135
Remember Exactly with angle.

215
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:13,765
That wasn't the angle.

216
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,455
It was that way.

217
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:15,835
Yep.

218
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:17,275
And it was slightly all elevated up.

219
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:17,815
Yep.

220
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:18,595
That was your angle.

221
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:19,435
Go from the finer needle.

222
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:20,965
If you do that, you'll come up where you want

223
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:23,970
it's

224
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:26,875
leah: noise.

225
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:30,085
Perfect.

226
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,730
Back and then we'll switch the gas to here.

227
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,475
leah: Alright, let's see.

228
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:38,465
Gallbladder.

229
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:41,405
There she is.

230
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:41,975
Okay.

231
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:43,235
All right.

232
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,585
Let's do our lateral track support.

233
00:21:44,585 --> 00:21:46,235
This is one I, um, think a lot about.

234
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:47,465
Okay, Dr. George.

235
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:50,465
So I just wanna double check that I don't put this in the wrong spot.

236
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,885
So you'll look a little more, um, inferior.

237
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,270
Yep.

238
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,150
brian: Which one do you think lot about?

239
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:01,270
Um, I'm thinking about my lateral and my second, my hand part.

240
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:01,350
Yeah.

241
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,375
That second board's really critical.

242
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,865
'cause the operator, if it's too far away, their shoulder's painful.

243
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:06,065
There's a lot of considerations.

244
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,765
leah: Is that an okay spot for the lateral cord?

245
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:09,665
brian: Yeah.

246
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,775
We haven't done one of these before.

247
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:10,985
Huh?

248
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:12,065
This probably shouldn't.

249
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:13,595
Not a while.

250
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:14,705
One with you first.

251
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:16,355
Nonetheless.

252
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,300
Physically annoying, so, yeah.

253
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:18,540
Yeah.

254
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,370
So, uh, to you, I mean, not to me.

255
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:20,850
Sorry.

256
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,095
Oh, well it would probably not me too.

257
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:31,680
So, uh, what I'd like to do is grab the gallbladder and, and so you take gallbladder and
you have a knuckle of it and you'll go across, so your angle of that port needs to be so up.

258
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,850
'cause if your down too much, your, your ends are gonna be in the middle of the gallbladder.

259
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,710
This, this is a gallbladder.

260
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,790
Mm-hmm.

261
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,980
If the ends are in there and then you push up it perforates there.

262
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,400
Okay.

263
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,460
So you want it all the way across, which means it needs to be down low enough to do that.

264
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:44,490
Okay.

265
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,700
So entirely depends on the anatomy of how tall the gallbladder is.

266
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,760
That looks like once you elevate, you'll be in an angle that's going up.

267
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,300
Mm-hmm.

268
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:52,320
And there looks fine.

269
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,990
If you need more room, you can go side, go upside down.

270
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,260
Right.

271
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,500
Would you

272
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,900
leah: go more down on the patient body wall?

273
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:57,960
So

274
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:00,655
brian: it's more inferior go the more you lose your angle actually.

275
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:00,815
Okay.

276
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:00,935
Alright.

277
00:23:00,935 --> 00:23:03,120
So it's actually fine to be somewhat higher.

278
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:03,455
Okay.

279
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:04,135
Okay.

280
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,150
Okay.

281
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,150
leah: I'll take the needle please.

282
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:22,844
Okay.

283
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:28,885
Okay.

284
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,379
Take the knife please.

285
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:40,469
Hemorrhage.

286
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,725
Ah, okay.

287
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,219
Thank you.

288
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:46,800
Mine your way, cat.

289
00:23:58,014 --> 00:23:58,310
All right.

290
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,030
We'll see if that's okay.

291
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,870
All right.

292
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,370
Okay.

293
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,389
Um, now we gotta do our other left hand port.

294
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,770
Okay.

295
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,379
You have another, um, no, we can take, we can just use this one and I can just towel, we'll do a towel clip.

296
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:12,440
Okay.

297
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:15,830
Okay.

298
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,280
So, Dr. George for this, um, left hand operating port,

299
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,080
my thought would be about here.

300
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,190
So it's not in the way.

301
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,950
brian: So

302
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,950
leah: it's relatively in line.

303
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,695
It's not blocking the camera.

304
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:34,976
The better

305
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:38,330
brian: is 'cause you can kind of move things around without hitting camera and hitting your other instrument.

306
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:38,600
Right.

307
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:38,815
Okay.

308
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:41,210
But the farther away you are, the worse it is on your left shoulder.

309
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:41,254
Right.

310
00:24:41,254 --> 00:24:44,060
Because it's farther away from your axis.

311
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:44,629
leah: Okay.

312
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:50,000
brian: Um, so I actually will do one, one hand away from that one.

313
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:51,200
Right?

314
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,040
That's little.

315
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:52,460
Yeah.

316
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,780
So I would actually bias a little more.

317
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,840
You're gonna find it's gonna be quite painful to your arm, otherwise, okay.

318
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,570
The up and down piece is relevant also for your shoulder.

319
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,600
The higher you are, the more triangulation spread there is.

320
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,340
The more your arm's up like that, right?

321
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,379
The lower you are, the more you're relaxed

322
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,100
leah: and have it where you want it.

323
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:07,429
Okay.

324
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,470
brian: So it's all trade offs.

325
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:14,360
There's no right answer in this, but don't, that seems like a
reasonable experiment and then you're gonna feel how it feels to you.

326
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:14,420
Okay?

327
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:15,170
Okay.

328
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,550
Could make it painful.

329
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,370
Yeah, it might be, but I, that looks reasonable to me.

330
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:19,879
leah: Okay.

331
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,770
brian: You know, it's a little, little more I than I would go.

332
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,370
But you're young.

333
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,649
So, and strong.

334
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,110
leah: Am I strong?

335
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,040
I hope so.

336
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,880
brian: She's young and strong.

337
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,590
I don't know if you're strong.

338
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,520
leah: Yeah, me neither.

339
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,170
Big and strong.

340
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,945
He's the youngest and strongest.

341
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,380
I may the weakest link on the team.

342
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:37,450
I probably, I was gonna say you're older too with like,

343
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,840
brian: are you older?

344
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,250
Are you nontraditional student

345
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,955
research for a few years and then got a master's.

346
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,850
I was, alright, we're gonna

347
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,230
leah: move the gas.

348
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,130
brian: You went straight?

349
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,190
leah: No, I did a two year fellowship up in Boston.

350
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,030
Where?

351
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,590
Uh, research fellowship In Boston.

352
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,150
brian: Research book?

353
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:04,810
Yeah.

354
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,325
Is that in Boston?

355
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:07,205
As in like Harvard?

356
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:08,885
Uh, I was in Boston.

357
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,450
leah: I was like through the Brigham.

358
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,970
brian: Oh, fancy.

359
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:15,520
You can always tell someone from Harvard.

360
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:16,485
leah: That's not me.

361
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:17,525
I didn't tell them much.

362
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:17,965
Hello?

363
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:19,325
That's not me.

364
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:20,440
I was just, I'm joking.

365
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,190
Yeah.

366
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,370
brian: I thought Good.

367
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,130
Say again.

368
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:29,105
I thought it was a good job.

369
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:30,290
It's not that good.

370
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:30,665
Okay.

371
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:30,995
leah: Speed.

372
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:31,535
All right.

373
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:32,585
Ports are in.

374
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:35,075
Okay.

375
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:37,890
It's this, uh, prestige.

376
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:38,675
Prestige.

377
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:39,725
Perfect.

378
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:41,555
Thanks.

379
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:43,265
You mind coming in, Kat?

380
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:43,325
So

381
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:49,210
brian: there's, there's a, a weird technique that maybe do, once you
get exposure, I'll, I'll show you how it do you, we a little head up.

382
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:50,315
We do know what we did.

383
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:51,875
It was inflamed was the one we did.

384
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:52,145
Oh, sorry.

385
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:53,165
I didn't, please.

386
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,455
It's so you know how to do it then.

387
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:55,685
Do you remember how to get the knuckle

388
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:57,125
with like, that's good.

389
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:00,635
The heating of like the, um, where like cough, you ock get

390
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:01,205
brian: a little knuckle.

391
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:01,655
Knuckle.

392
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:01,865
Boom.

393
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:02,585
Remember that?

394
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:03,155
Yeah.

395
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:03,845
Kind of.

396
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:04,325
I know.

397
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:04,745
Yes.

398
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:05,885
I remember us doing it.

399
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:09,170
I don't know if I remember all the movements, but I remember like you talk, you got,

400
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,355
brian: can you get a hunter in your right hand?

401
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:10,565
Yep.

402
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:13,175
I'll, I'll help.

403
00:27:14,975 --> 00:27:15,725
You can grab what you grab.

404
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,175
Oh, okay.

405
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:16,655
That's fine.

406
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:16,775
Cool.

407
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:19,175
She's gonna grab it and hand it back to you in a meaningful way.

408
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:20,345
That's not gonna be the real grab.

409
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:21,005
Okay.

410
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:22,385
Grab right next door.

411
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:22,535
Now.

412
00:27:22,535 --> 00:27:23,015
Solid.

413
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:23,975
Right there.

414
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:24,515
Solid.

415
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:26,195
Not too much.

416
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:26,825
Just a little.

417
00:27:28,465 --> 00:27:29,035
And grab right there.

418
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:32,395
There.

419
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,085
Hard.

420
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,005
Now pull If you don't slip.

421
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:37,315
Okay, now you're gonna lift it up.

422
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:38,430
Let go of your hand.

423
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,790
Okay.

424
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:39,475
Okay.

425
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,185
Now go underneath her all the way across.

426
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:41,635
Oh, yep.

427
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:42,325
Now I remember this.

428
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:44,185
The little baby bite and then the cross all the

429
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:44,755
brian: way across.

430
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:45,805
Crush it.

431
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:46,915
Good.

432
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,425
That's good enough.

433
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:49,525
leah: Okay.

434
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:50,215
I'm locked.

435
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:50,365
Lock it.

436
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:50,935
You can let it go.

437
00:27:51,055 --> 00:27:52,075
brian: I hope you don't have, have fat in there.

438
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:52,885
I think you avoided it.

439
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,635
I think I avoided it.

440
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:54,205
I think I went about it.

441
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:54,780
I'm gonna let, let go.

442
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,260
Yep.

443
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:55,795
I'm locked.

444
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:56,245
Let's go.

445
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:56,665
And that's good.

446
00:27:57,265 --> 00:28:00,025
And then that avoids putting your tips into the middle of a gall ladder.

447
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:00,295
Nice.

448
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:00,655
Yeah.

449
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:01,105
That's really nice.

450
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:03,865
Which especially it's inflamed is not a viable solution.

451
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:04,345
Yeah.

452
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:04,580
Okay.

453
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:05,635
leah: Okay.

454
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,905
Um, do you, diggen, do you mind taking the camera from Kat?

455
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,175
brian: I'm, you're gonna be happier if you go.

456
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:17,080
leah: And then once he does, you can grab another grasper.

457
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:17,350
Yeah.

458
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,740
Perfect.

459
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,710
The question's gonna be, did I really avoid that piece of fat right there?

460
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,860
Oh,

461
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,460
thank you.

462
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,115
And then can we get the room lights down please?

463
00:28:26,754 --> 00:28:26,955
Absolutely.

464
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:27,274
Nice.

465
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:27,754
Thank you ladies.

466
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:30,465
You dig?

467
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:32,825
Okay.

468
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:36,655
leah: Then she'll take another grasper.

469
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:42,565
Do you want camera table down or do you wanna step

470
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,215
Um, I was gonna say table down.

471
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:48,655
And then actually, should we, before we, should we put her in, um, reverse trend down?

472
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:49,885
You want more head

473
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:50,125
leah: up?

474
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:51,235
Yeah, like more head up?

475
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:51,475
leah: Yeah.

476
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:52,195
Can we get more head up?

477
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:53,514
And then

478
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:55,375
leah: that's good.

479
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,295
And we'll get the table down a little bit.

480
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:00,925
leah: Then can we get table down just a bit and she'll tell you when to stop

481
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:03,055
demanding while we got everything positioned.

482
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:04,735
Yeah, we can get spots off.

483
00:29:04,795 --> 00:29:04,825
Okay.

484
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:05,395
leah: Yeah.

485
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:05,815
Thank you.

486
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,129
Did you ladies need light?

487
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:08,815
leah: You good?

488
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:09,235
You're good.

489
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:09,685
Brent.

490
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:11,395
Up to her.

491
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:11,965
That's good.

492
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,285
And then we get a little bit more head up.

493
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,095
leah: We have a footboard, right?

494
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:17,605
Perfect.

495
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:19,254
Yep, we do good.

496
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:19,257
All right.

497
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:19,259
This'll be

498
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:19,300
good.

499
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:19,735
leah: Okay.

500
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,465
So let's make sure I got the fat out of that.

501
00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:28,405
Not in my jaws, just gentle sweeps, sort of right where the top is.

502
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,825
And I would use both hands if you can and just kind of take both pieces down.

503
00:29:35,004 --> 00:29:37,915
I would start, yeah, right up, right underneath my jaws.

504
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:40,405
If you can't get there, you can try to find another plane

505
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,745
and you can like grab a tiny piece of it and pull straight down.

506
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:48,745
Just don't push into it.

507
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:49,345
Yeah.

508
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:51,565
Nice.

509
00:29:51,565 --> 00:29:51,745
And that

510
00:29:51,745 --> 00:29:52,975
leah: looks nice and clear.

511
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,600
Um, I'm gonna fix your, you must have worked out this morning.

512
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,625
Your muscle I rip through.

513
00:30:05,735 --> 00:30:06,245
leah: I would try, yeah.

514
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:10,595
I try to grab the really wispy right up at the top, so I'd let go and draw right up at the top.

515
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:11,705
Yeah.

516
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:12,125
Right there

517
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:13,446
with you.

518
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,120
Nice.

519
00:30:15,635 --> 00:30:16,320
And when I came in the room I was like.

520
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:18,525
leah: Nice.

521
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:20,525
Okay.

522
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:24,190
And then you have to regrab with your left and come back at that area there.

523
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,640
Perfect.

524
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,180
Nice.

525
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,730
And if you can't, you can always like hook right through that clear stuff if you need to,

526
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,920
because that's clearly nice and clear.

527
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,830
leah: We just don't wanna rip.

528
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,790
If we have can't.

529
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,570
But you're doing great.

530
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,380
Show it to yourself.

531
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:44,770
Nice.

532
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,040
Yeah.

533
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,900
And you can hook that if you want to.

534
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,710
brian: Both this,

535
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,070
leah: yeah.

536
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:48,820
Stay

537
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,390
brian: right where you are.

538
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,950
So when you grab here, you want to rip there, right?

539
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,690
But it can rip anywhere between here and there.

540
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,140
That's what, yeah.

541
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,640
And it's gonna rip in the weakest spot.

542
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,130
The weakest spot is actually gonna be the fat.

543
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,180
Okay.

544
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,780
And what'll happen is you'll rip, the veins will break and it'll bleed and you won't be able to see anything.

545
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,260
So you want to grab as close to the plane as you can so you don't rip fat.

546
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,950
Okay.

547
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

548
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,095
You can use, you can always the other side of the plane too,

549
00:31:19,665 --> 00:31:20,015
brian: right?

550
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,830
They're.

551
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:32,670
Yeah.

552
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,740
They need a little light to get a better view of what we're doing for the research project.

553
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:38,670
Okay.

554
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,290
So lemme

555
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:40,680
brian: troubleshoot.

556
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:42,055
Okay.

557
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,530
leah: It's easier.

558
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,150
You can hook that with your right hand

559
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,360
or not.

560
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,800
leah: Yeah.

561
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:55,770
I mean, if you can, if you wouldn't, because right there, if you grab
right on the edge of that lip rather than the fat, you would've had it.

562
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,980
So a smaller, smaller grab Yeah.

563
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,240
Of that portion.

564
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,870
Yeah, exactly.

565
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,140
Nice.

566
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,830
And you should be able to pull that down and you can use your right hand for tension against the gallbladder.

567
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:07,135
And

568
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,830
leah: if you wanna hook it, you're totally fine to hook it because I don't want you to rip the fat or anything.

569
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:20,880
You're good.

570
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:21,750
You're doing great.

571
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,560
leah: Yeah.

572
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,270
I'd grab right where that thing wants to rip.

573
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:24,900
Yeah, right.

574
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,890
Like right there.

575
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,610
Yeah.

576
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,360
Nice.

577
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,735
leah: I was just gonna go.

578
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:36,495
Yeah.

579
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:36,615
Yeah.

580
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,290
You can get your hook.

581
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:51,505
I would hook it.

582
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:52,225
What?

583
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:52,905
I would hook it.

584
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:54,305
Yeah.

585
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,280
Yeah.

586
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:08,730
Nice.

587
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,560
Now you Yeah, you can heal that if you want to.

588
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:10,889
Perfect.

589
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,959
And then keep pulling with your left.

590
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:13,199
Nice.

591
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,459
Okay.

592
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:18,270
I'd re grab, um, up on gallbladder.

593
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,330
Oh, let's see.

594
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,959
leah: Just be careful with that grab.

595
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:30,270
You may wanna grab slightly more on that lip.

596
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,139
Yeah, right there.

597
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:31,770
Yeah.

598
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,220
Nice.

599
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,570
Oh yeah.

600
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,459
Be careful once it gets too much.

601
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,139
Okay.

602
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,370
Nice.

603
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,419
I wouldn't grab too low.

604
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:58,980
I keep working where you're working on that.

605
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,159
Perfect.

606
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,629
A little bit.

607
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,230
Yeah.

608
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,071
You see that plane right there towards posterior, actually this sky right here?

609
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:05,310
Yeah, right there.

610
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,260
So if you grab that super wispy white stuff.

611
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,279
Close to the gallbladder.

612
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,250
Yeah, right there.

613
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:11,759
Nice.

614
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,139
That's a nice clear.

615
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:19,045
You should be able to come down with, and you can pull out a hook if you need to, or you can just pull,

616
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:22,165
brian: is this, are you seeing reflection from the light?

617
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:23,065
leah: Me?

618
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:24,235
Uh, my view's still totally fine screen.

619
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:24,925
No, it's fine.

620
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:27,535
brian: You're not, 'cause it's should be bouncing down.

621
00:34:27,595 --> 00:34:27,685
Mm-hmm.

622
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:29,335
But I wanna make sure it's not bouncing back to you.

623
00:34:30,175 --> 00:34:30,775
No, it's fine.

624
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:31,380
Your image is okay.

625
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,625
And you can, um,

626
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,355
leah: if you wanna hook that you can or you can keep pulling down.

627
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:38,525
It's okay for now.

628
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:38,735
Yeah.

629
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:39,400
Well not

630
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:39,719
brian: Okay.

631
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,600
The surgery.

632
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,040
Yeah.

633
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:45,634
leah: Nice.

634
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:46,505
You wanna hook that?

635
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:47,600
If you need to totally fine.

636
00:34:57,515 --> 00:34:58,805
Maybe come back for a sec day.

637
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,615
'cause she should find herself.

638
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:00,245
I just called you day.

639
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:00,545
Wow.

640
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:01,205
A little nickname.

641
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:02,315
Sorry.

642
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:05,375
If like, if you were like, Hey, that's not my name, please tell us.

643
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:06,424
Well, I made up

644
00:35:06,424 --> 00:35:07,985
leah: a nickname of my own accord.

645
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:08,855
Yeah.

646
00:35:08,855 --> 00:35:11,075
Where it's pulling, you have good tension right there.

647
00:35:11,495 --> 00:35:13,985
You can come through that wispy with your hook.

648
00:35:15,424 --> 00:35:16,235
I wouldn't, yeah.

649
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:20,225
I wouldn't necessarily heal if I didn't have to just poke through.

650
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,040
Yeah.

651
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,040
Which is fine,

652
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:27,035
but yeah.

653
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:27,365
Nice.

654
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:35,045
leah: Yeah.

655
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,365
And then come back through that hole.

656
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:37,680
Nice.

657
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:42,810
And then use your left hand a little bit more to give a better fan to keep that angle nice.

658
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,900
Yeah, exactly.

659
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,390
Okay.

660
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:48,960
Nice.

661
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:50,640
And

662
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,930
leah: now we're getting a little low.

663
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,680
Just fine.

664
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,720
I'd regrab with your left closer to that whisk.

665
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,735
Uh, I'll have, I can, I can say like who?

666
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:03,535
Nice.

667
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,730
And just make sure you really thin it out.

668
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,470
'cause I can't see through all that fat right now.

669
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:17,730
Yeah, you're good.

670
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,110
Maybe grab that other lip.

671
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,500
Yeah.

672
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:19,560
I

673
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,259
was thinking this other little wispy guy here might be a little,

674
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,470
leah: I grab, uh, maybe a little closer to gallbladder.

675
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,819
I think you're grabbing a little too low.

676
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,210
Yeah.

677
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,290
And I, yeah.

678
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,600
And then use your left to fan sort of lateral if you can.

679
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,339
Uh, lateral.

680
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,299
Yeah.

681
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:47,480
Yeah.

682
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,990
That way you're showing yourself that hole better and stay really thin.

683
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,330
Yeah.

684
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:53,660
Nice.

685
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,410
Now you have that hole.

686
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:54,830
leah: Perfect.

687
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:55,819
Nice.

688
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:01,040
Yeah, she's definitely had some chronic inflammation here.

689
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,279
Huh?

690
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:10,730
It's a little thick, but probably just fat.

691
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,100
I was just looking to see if anything was down.

692
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,300
Yeah, yeah, me too.

693
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,745
Before, can you come in a little bit?

694
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:19,160
Taken Nice.

695
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,810
leah: Yeah, that looks nice and clear.

696
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,480
Just show yourself

697
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,780
and use your left hand to keep pulling it lateral.

698
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,140
Yeah.

699
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,710
Nice.

700
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,250
Yeah.

701
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,600
See how you're showing it more with that.

702
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,920
Nice.

703
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,180
Perfect.

704
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:35,660
Okay.

705
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,700
Just be careful healing down into that 'cause you're getting close to.

706
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,070
All right, well let me pull, do you mind coming back just a hair day again?

707
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,460
I wanna take a peek at what kind of, there we go.

708
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,840
Great.

709
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:53,930
Nice.

710
00:37:57,855 --> 00:38:01,670
Then we'll come in and then Nice in the horizon hall a little bit.

711
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:02,745
Other way.

712
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:04,905
Other way.

713
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,350
Uh, it'll be turning your hand and putting like, so

714
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:09,620
brian: this is to you?

715
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:09,770
Yeah.

716
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,420
You're gonna have to teach him.

717
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,800
Oh my bad.

718
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:13,425
How to do this.

719
00:38:13,515 --> 00:38:13,865
leah: Sorry.

720
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:15,705
I was thinking about the, I know dissection.

721
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:16,065
This is the hard part.

722
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:16,425
I know.

723
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:17,690
Teaching to operate

724
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,580
brian: is the hardest thing done in my by far, so, so it's a lot of cognitive load.

725
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,450
Okay.

726
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:23,985
So you're gonna have to make sure my bad.

727
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:24,980
Pay attention to everything.

728
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,070
Right.

729
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:26,810
leah: Cool.

730
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,530
And keep grabbing.

731
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:27,710
Yeah.

732
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,300
Nice and high on gallbladder.

733
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:29,780
Where that

734
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,630
brian: pull that way.

735
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,500
Don't pull that way.

736
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:37,274
It's more likely to rip in the plane then and grab closer.

737
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:37,935
Yeah,

738
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,825
leah: and I, yeah, like he said, grab closer.

739
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:51,404
Yeah, the end plane pulls.

740
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:52,395
That's a really good point.

741
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:53,385
Dr. George.

742
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:02,115
brian: Your time's off by middle, so grab it.

743
00:39:02,354 --> 00:39:02,984
So your right.

744
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:03,915
See that little lip there?

745
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:04,245
Fat.

746
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:05,325
That's where you wanna be grabbing.

747
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,285
I use a Maryland for this.

748
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:09,254
It's usually more precise, but it doesn't matter really.

749
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:10,004
Yeah, that's good.

750
00:39:10,154 --> 00:39:10,515
Nice.

751
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:10,634
Good

752
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:10,875
grab.

753
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,395
I'm trying to think about how do I get my left hand in there to help me a little bit more?

754
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:16,725
You can,

755
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:16,979
brian: what?

756
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:21,345
What I do is I use my left hand strip and I use my right hand to grab if I want, if I have both.

757
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:24,819
Otherwise, just she's your right hand and you use your right hand against her.

758
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:25,100
Right hand.

759
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:25,819
Okay.

760
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,480
leah: Yeah, that's a really good lip grab right there.

761
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,050
Nice

762
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,040
brian: go.

763
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,760
leah: And then pull.

764
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,510
Yeah.

765
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,260
Nice and down.

766
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,180
I think you can get that lip again with your Right.

767
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,140
Nice.

768
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,830
Good job.

769
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,460
This may need to be a left hand lip grab.

770
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:42,845
Yeah,

771
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:45,925
right there.

772
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,900
Yeah, exactly.

773
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,440
leah: And then remember pulling in planes so it's a little more down than lateral.

774
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:55,280
Yeah, just right here.

775
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,440
Here.

776
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,440
Up there.

777
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,480
Above.

778
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:00,005
Right there.

779
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,726
brian: You can't see very well because There you go.

780
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:04,120
There you go.

781
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:04,760
Nice.

782
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,560
A little above that.

783
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,120
Like here?

784
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:08,720
Yeah.

785
00:40:09,635 --> 00:40:11,795
brian: And then you can rip with impunity because you know where it's gonna rest.

786
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:12,245
Nice.

787
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:16,085
leah: And I'd swing back around digging if you can.

788
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,335
Your place playing dancing with her.

789
00:40:19,745 --> 00:40:20,255
It's probably mild.

790
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:20,495
Generally

791
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:20,945
brian: speaking here.

792
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:23,675
This instrument, or this is for you, David?

793
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,370
The instruments you want to point?

794
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,480
Not on the top.

795
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,295
It's coming on top.

796
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,945
The instrument itself is blocking the view.

797
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:31,955
If it comes off to the side, they can see around.

798
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:32,435
Got it.

799
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,000
So right there, she can't see behind her tip.

800
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,080
Right.

801
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:41,465
So you're gonna move back and forth and rotate the camera to get these things in corners or sides.

802
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:41,840
Okay.

803
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,040
Okay.

804
00:40:42,215 --> 00:40:42,545
Okay.

805
00:40:42,545 --> 00:40:42,725
Let's

806
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:43,865
leah: see how low we are.

807
00:40:43,865 --> 00:40:44,705
'cause I'm seeing

808
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:46,775
brian: it's, it takes practice.

809
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:47,315
leah: Yeah.

810
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:49,355
Okay.

811
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:50,945
Nice.

812
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:51,155
All right.

813
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:53,135
Lemme give you a better retraction now that we're pulled a bit.

814
00:40:53,315 --> 00:40:53,585
Okay.

815
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:54,485
I think you can get that one.

816
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:55,775
Uh, super wispy lip down.

817
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:56,465
Yeah.

818
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:13,865
brian: This is really great.

819
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:14,435
Yes.

820
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:15,155
Nice job.

821
00:41:15,335 --> 00:41:15,730
This is perfect.

822
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:17,384
For your learning.

823
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,725
leah: Oh yeah.

824
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:21,225
I don't just be careful Too much of that.

825
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:22,665
brian: And you're learning.

826
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,310
Yeah.

827
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:23,565
leah: Yeah.

828
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:24,134
This is huge.

829
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:25,125
Alright,

830
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:25,575
brian: sorry to again.

831
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:29,174
So you're pulling up so much, you're making it pad, oh, I'm making it worse.

832
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,590
See how it, it should unfold a little bit.

833
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:32,430
It doesn't always work.

834
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:32,910
Let's see.

835
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:37,580
And it's, this is hard though 'cause that left road is like, it's right in the way.

836
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,030
Creeping.

837
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:38,630
Yeah.

838
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:40,850
We still hang out.

839
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,230
brian: It really does.

840
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:42,860
Okay.

841
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,810
It's hard to see it as critical structure, so.

842
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,320
Exactly.

843
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,350
So if you can't see a structure, what can you do?

844
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,480
So we can think about's, two options.

845
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,670
Think about like camera angle or retraction.

846
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:53,600
Okay, sure.

847
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,200
Three options.

848
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,920
We can like get the, like see if we can like kind of push this out.

849
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,070
Good.

850
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,820
That's number two.

851
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,120
Yeah.

852
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,140
What's the third option?

853
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:03,350
Um, this is really important

854
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,220
brian: for laparoscopy.

855
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,020
Move the tissue.

856
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:07,085
It's like

857
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:09,575
brian: we do it all the time and I make that

858
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:12,005
like an additional retractor port for that does No,

859
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:13,085
brian: sorry.

860
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:18,695
Move the, move the thing you're operating on so you can move the
things around so you can change your angle of view, which he's doing.

861
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:19,025
Mm-hmm.

862
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:22,746
You can change the things around you blocking your view or you can change what you're operating on.

863
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,190
Okay.

864
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:23,470
And

865
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:28,895
brian: if you grab the gall port out of the FSA and you're looking around, you can move it to where you can see.

866
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:29,585
Nice.

867
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:29,795
leah: Okay.

868
00:42:30,035 --> 00:42:31,625
So we'll get that left hand Good grab

869
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:36,260
like here kind of making sure though that we have like a good left.

870
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:38,435
leah: I don't know about that grab.

871
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:40,355
That's where I wanna work.

872
00:42:40,445 --> 00:42:41,525
So there, yeah.

873
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:42,785
leah: Yeah, exactly.

874
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:46,805
brian: Little slip

875
00:42:49,835 --> 00:42:50,075
grab you

876
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:53,020
and then pull Jeff

877
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:53,620
leah: Grab.

878
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:59,525
I think you're going to um, be folding the tissue.

879
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:03,635
A hair with that grab, which is like, this is my hardest thing.

880
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:03,740
I'm trying

881
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,565
to think of like going lateral like we talked about and kind of like rolling it into my instrument.

882
00:43:07,895 --> 00:43:08,645
brian: Oh, you wanna go lateral?

883
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:09,635
So where are you held up?

884
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,180
Where you held up?

885
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:12,365
Where do you want to dissect her?

886
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:12,875
To dissect her?

887
00:43:13,115 --> 00:43:14,540
leah: I wanna You have Q-tips open by any chance?

888
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:15,725
I wanna get this.

889
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:17,765
brian: She's gonna give you a Q-tip Oh wow.

890
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:19,055
At the screen with Cool.

891
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:19,415
leah: Okay.

892
00:43:20,405 --> 00:43:22,820
If the liver over outta the way she exposed for her to be able to see.

893
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:25,115
I wanna get this down and I'm wanna dissect here.

894
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,125
So I was trying to figure out how do I grab this, pull away.

895
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:27,740
That's okay.

896
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,690
Let still make sure that this, I can access this guy and like these whiskeys right here, I'll try

897
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:33,710
leah: to grab around here.

898
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,030
I think that's a, that's gonna rip.

899
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,790
Yeah, that's too, uh, you need a lot of tissue so it

900
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,510
brian: has more integrity.

901
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,520
leah: Yeah, exactly.

902
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,830
So avoiding grabbing that and grabbing more on this side with.

903
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:46,755
More tissue.

904
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:51,134
brian: So what I'm starting to see is this is gonna be in Right, exactly.

905
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:52,480
I think we can, that's gonna be that turn.

906
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:52,759
Mm-hmm.

907
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,335
I talked about on this, on this model here.

908
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:55,480
Mm-hmm.

909
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:55,815
Mm-hmm.

910
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:57,825
And then this stuff, you're still looking for that.

911
00:43:57,825 --> 00:43:58,545
I don't know where it is.

912
00:43:58,545 --> 00:43:59,505
I don't fat over there.

913
00:43:59,505 --> 00:43:59,775
Right.

914
00:44:02,595 --> 00:44:03,195
But we'll see it.

915
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:04,095
Okay.

916
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:06,735
That's where probably you're end up doing that move where you pull it out and suck it in.

917
00:44:06,735 --> 00:44:08,025
I'll, I bet you.

918
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:10,035
But she's gotta get gun grab to really make a point.

919
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,320
Right?

920
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,480
Yeah.

921
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,840
'cause you know this is gonna roll.

922
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:13,240
Right.

923
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:13,255
Right.

924
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:14,205
leah: Okay.

925
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:18,225
Now to get this down is our next step.

926
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:25,005
I feel like we could either, I don't know if you're a big kitten or
person versus just continuing to get, like, Marilyn, make a plane.

927
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:25,425
Hook it.

928
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:26,085
brian: Sure.

929
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,215
I, I am a, I'm fine kidding nurse, but I will usually don't use just Marilyn.

930
00:44:31,275 --> 00:44:31,485
Okay.

931
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:32,925
I mean, it's not super in plain anything.

932
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:34,485
I usually use a sucker if it's bad enough.

933
00:44:34,515 --> 00:44:34,875
Okay.

934
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:37,545
leah: And I think your left hand isn't helping you yet.

935
00:44:37,545 --> 00:44:37,605
No.

936
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:38,565
Yeah.

937
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:40,305
I think we were just,

938
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:42,315
brian: you know, coach her.

939
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:43,785
Tell me what you want, not what you don't want.

940
00:44:44,025 --> 00:44:44,325
leah: Okay.

941
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:45,735
brian: What do you want?

942
00:44:45,855 --> 00:44:47,625
leah: I think I still want a bit more tissue.

943
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:48,525
If you can get it.

944
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,565
This is hard, Kat.

945
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:51,795
This is the hardest part, in my opinion.

946
00:44:53,115 --> 00:44:56,715
Truly the problem is maybe I'm screwing you up.

947
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:57,884
Maybe I'm holding too hard.

948
00:44:58,995 --> 00:45:00,555
Yeah, I'd grab right around there air.

949
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:07,755
brian: So I think it's too, the area you're making is you're not opening your grasper enough.

950
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,520
That's okay.

951
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,765
brian: And put it all the way up.

952
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:10,995
Push it all the way in.

953
00:45:11,415 --> 00:45:11,775
Okay.

954
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:13,275
Right there.

955
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,930
Yeah, push it all the way in now grab now.

956
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:18,560
That's a good bite.

957
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,220
Nice.

958
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:19,250
Okay.

959
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,759
And then you can,

960
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,130
leah: um, palm if you, if you're able Yeah, definitely palm.

961
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:22,340
Yeah.

962
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,340
I made my thumb numb for six months when I didn't palm.

963
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,049
brian: Oh yeah.

964
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,340
That makes me so sad.

965
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:28,670
It was a,

966
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,540
leah: it was a me problem.

967
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:29,960
It.

968
00:45:30,515 --> 00:45:30,875
Cool.

969
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:34,115
Um, I'm trying to think about Nice.

970
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:38,795
I think Deon, if you don't mind coming back for a hot sec just so I can orient myself.

971
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:39,365
Yeah.

972
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:40,625
Okay.

973
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:41,045
Nice.

974
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:41,405
Yeah.

975
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:45,245
See, I feel like I see that turn coming in there, so we're gonna have to clear off this area.

976
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:47,075
Yeah.

977
00:45:48,905 --> 00:45:49,175
Yeah.

978
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,365
If you're able to thin out any of that tissue,

979
00:45:55,175 --> 00:45:57,695
keeping that good pull with your left that you had, I think that, that

980
00:45:59,795 --> 00:46:01,775
gallbladder, I still think we're zoomed in.

981
00:46:01,775 --> 00:46:02,405
I hear too much.

982
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:07,520
Yeah,

983
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:10,085
leah: I agree.

984
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:11,615
There's such a bad glare.

985
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:11,975
Yeah.

986
00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:16,530
Let's, let's clean it and just like chill for a hot sec. Okay.

987
00:46:16,715 --> 00:46:17,015
Okay.

988
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:18,815
Because we gotta get that down.

989
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:23,435
And once we have that down, you'll be able to get a better pull and we'll get a better idea of our anatomy.

990
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:29,795
And then I know he likes to work sort of in that space right by the liver.

991
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:30,785
Mm-hmm.

992
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:31,146
First, yeah.

993
00:46:36,654 --> 00:46:37,345
My glasses.

994
00:46:37,615 --> 00:46:38,395
Is that what you're laughing at?

995
00:46:38,694 --> 00:46:39,505
No, I'm not laughing

996
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:39,714
brian: at all.

997
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,125
I'm appreciating this moment.

998
00:46:41,335 --> 00:46:42,145
This is wonderful.

999
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:43,765
Isn't this wonderful cat doing?

1000
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:47,005
We're helping this patient first and foremost, which is great.

1001
00:46:47,484 --> 00:46:48,895
And second of all, you guys are learning.

1002
00:46:49,404 --> 00:46:50,335
You're working together.

1003
00:46:50,845 --> 00:46:51,805
leah: Cat's doing a great job.

1004
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:53,154
brian: We're all learning, frankly.

1005
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:53,575
It's great.

1006
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,345
leah: Okay, so let's get re get that.

1007
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:55,765
Good grab.

1008
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:56,424
You had Kat.

1009
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,120
brian: Oh, not too high.

1010
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,290
Your camera angle should be between, generally between 10 and two o'clock.

1011
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,840
Like where And you're, yeah.

1012
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,040
Generally between 10 and two.

1013
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,320
If you're on the left side over here looking here, it'll be 10.

1014
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,790
If you're over here it'll be two.

1015
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:16,810
Okay.

1016
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:16,870
Okay.

1017
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,350
We'll go.

1018
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,980
But you can definitely vary between, between two.

1019
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,460
Feel free to Okay.

1020
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:27,160
But you almost never should be looking straight off, unless you're simply looking at your abdominal wall.

1021
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,360
leah: I feel like that's distorting our anatomy, but I think that you're still in step three.

1022
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:37,630
Yeah.

1023
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,400
I think the grab is just still gonna get that stuff done.

1024
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:39,730
Yeah.

1025
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:40,330
Okay.

1026
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:40,390
I

1027
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,755
brian: think there's more to go.

1028
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,040
Okay.

1029
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:43,235
But, and I think it's too high.

1030
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:44,195
Is that what you say too?

1031
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:44,290
Yeah.

1032
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:44,560
Too

1033
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:44,830
leah: high.

1034
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,960
And I think that it's getting, um, twisted.

1035
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,930
brian: It's hard to see.

1036
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,170
Like can you, can you do us a favor and just move this liver outta the way for a second?

1037
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:51,980
Let's just take a look.

1038
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,040
Yeah.

1039
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,670
What we got over there?

1040
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:53,720
Okay.

1041
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,310
And then can you grab right there?

1042
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,690
Kind of, this is in pw.

1043
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,200
You see it there?

1044
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:57,470
Yeah.

1045
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,755
Grab right in in.

1046
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,320
Be grabbing some of that fat.

1047
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,820
There's vessel arter, arteries there.

1048
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:02,235
Arties there.

1049
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,810
That ridge.

1050
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,500
The ridge is there.

1051
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,760
Artery almost certainly.

1052
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,140
Push in.

1053
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:06,740
No, no, no.

1054
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,040
Come on.

1055
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,780
That's it.

1056
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,870
Now pull this way towards the hip.

1057
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:13,460
It's hard.

1058
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:13,790
You got it.

1059
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,710
It's the hardest part of the truly seven year program.

1060
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,100
You're good.

1061
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,250
leah: I still struggle with the ground crushed.

1062
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:22,970
brian: Yeah, you're not, you're not getting your, once you push in, push in and engage.

1063
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:23,415
There you go.

1064
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,080
Now grab it.

1065
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:24,710
That's it.

1066
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,370
Nice.

1067
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:27,860
Okay, now let's look behind here.

1068
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,210
Megan, you do at too nice.

1069
00:48:29,485 --> 00:48:29,775
Okay.

1070
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,610
Okay, so I see gallbladder here still.

1071
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:33,225
So it's gonna be down there, I think.

1072
00:48:33,225 --> 00:48:33,855
Which is hard.

1073
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:35,805
Yeah's, that's just hard.

1074
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:40,154
So I, but I see this here, so I'm gonna guess it's right there.

1075
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:45,045
So, because you can't see back here, I would actually start just scoring right there to be honest.

1076
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,150
You think so that Yeah.

1077
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,687
I'm sorry I didn't ask you what you want to do that.

1078
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:48,430
No, that's why I'm,

1079
00:48:49,065 --> 00:48:49,665
leah: that's totally fine.

1080
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:50,805
I would love What are you thinking?

1081
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,110
I think it's little too late.

1082
00:48:53,415 --> 00:48:53,925
No, that's fine.

1083
00:48:53,925 --> 00:48:57,227
I was gonna say, I think we could take this shitty tissue there, you that for sure.

1084
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,015
And get that down percent that may give, give us a little more freedom.

1085
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:00,855
brian: So that's good.

1086
00:49:00,915 --> 00:49:02,445
And I'm sorry I didn't say that explicitly.

1087
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:05,595
I was wondering if we do that too, but if we're too low, we're doing stuff we don't need to do.

1088
00:49:05,595 --> 00:49:06,285
It's not useful.

1089
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:07,275
I don't think we are.

1090
00:49:07,634 --> 00:49:09,045
I think that's stuff's actually very useful.

1091
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:10,725
I think plane wanted come across this here.

1092
00:49:10,725 --> 00:49:11,085
Yeah, I think so too.

1093
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:11,270
Okay.

1094
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,825
Because I could see our gall water turning there.

1095
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:13,470
Yeah, I that's what I'm

1096
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:13,710
seeing too.

1097
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:13,995
Yeah.

1098
00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:15,015
Okay, great.

1099
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,605
In, in whatever order you wanna do, that's fine.

1100
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:17,775
As long as we have the same mental model.

1101
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:17,985
Yeah.

1102
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:21,375
leah: Up to you Kat.

1103
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:26,715
If you want to keep thinning with that versus if you wanna do like
layer by layer, getting through, through hook thinning and taking it.

1104
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:27,495
Good technique.

1105
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:29,175
I think layer like going.

1106
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,975
Um, let's see.

1107
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:32,895
Where if like taking a layer helps out.

1108
00:49:32,895 --> 00:49:33,470
Yes, I think

1109
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:33,750
leah: so too.

1110
00:49:33,825 --> 00:49:36,705
I think that, um, it'll be better with the hook faster and, uh.

1111
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:46,780
Nice.

1112
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,800
leah: And then come in a bit digging.

1113
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:48,340
Yeah.

1114
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,350
And we're gonna get this schmutz here.

1115
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,540
I feel like you have an anterior lip you can take.

1116
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,600
Yeah, I'd come in on that side

1117
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,280
leah: and that'd get this,

1118
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:00,970
this guy.

1119
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,060
So come in like this.

1120
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:04,930
Yeah.

1121
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,490
And I'd say about right there.

1122
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:06,730
Yeah.

1123
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,330
A little lower.

1124
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:07,660
Yeah,

1125
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,690
leah: just get your hook through, thin it out.

1126
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:11,800
Make sure it's safe.

1127
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,440
Make sure you have tension with your Oh, oh yeah.

1128
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,070
You gotta regrab

1129
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,080
brian: and then there's time management.

1130
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:29,470
Yeah.

1131
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,640
You have to do too, right?

1132
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,740
'cause you're not gonna get through the case in, in a reasonable time at this velocity.

1133
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,620
Just monitoring that.

1134
00:50:38,695 --> 00:50:39,910
As long as she's making progress.

1135
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,550
My general policy keep going, but there's always a limit to it.

1136
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,050
Okay.

1137
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:48,280
leah: And keep that good tension that you had with your left hand 'cause that was showing it to you.

1138
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,675
Um, out not, not up that way.

1139
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:53,555
It's okay.

1140
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:54,305
Sorry.

1141
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:58,475
leah: Do you ever use a locking grasper on the gallbladder if it's not inflamed or No.

1142
00:50:58,475 --> 00:50:59,255
'cause it concussion.

1143
00:50:59,735 --> 00:51:03,605
brian: So it's interesting because I'm an a CS surgeon, it's very rare that we have a gall bladder that looks like this.

1144
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:03,606
Yeah.

1145
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:05,600
And any of the gall, go ahead, please.

1146
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,545
Oh no, I was gonna

1147
00:51:06,545 --> 00:51:07,085
leah: say nice cat.

1148
00:51:07,085 --> 00:51:09,095
Yeah, that's where you need to get under is that lip right there.

1149
00:51:10,115 --> 00:51:10,895
Push, push, push.

1150
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:11,705
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.

1151
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:12,215
brian: Almost never.

1152
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,134
'cause it's lacerating and inflamed tissues.

1153
00:51:14,225 --> 00:51:14,555
leah: Nice.

1154
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:14,915
Okay.

1155
00:51:14,915 --> 00:51:16,295
Pull out and take it.

1156
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:16,565
Great.

1157
00:51:17,555 --> 00:51:20,615
That's exactly what we're gonna keep doing is working through that schmutz there.

1158
00:51:22,595 --> 00:51:23,315
brian: Nice technique.

1159
00:51:23,315 --> 00:51:25,955
You know, I go, she knows this, who we talking?

1160
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:27,275
Go into that and sweep up and down.

1161
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:27,365
Yes.

1162
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:30,425
Because that's actually dissecting it off of the ductal structure.

1163
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:36,005
And you need to, so once you get into that plane sweep, if you're gonna use hook for d dissection, which I love to do,

1164
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:37,790
I'm just Yeah,

1165
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:38,390
leah: no,

1166
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,670
you're okay.

1167
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,025
Having a hard time.

1168
00:51:40,235 --> 00:51:40,865
There's nothing there.

1169
00:51:40,955 --> 00:51:41,405
leah: You're fine.

1170
00:51:41,405 --> 00:51:47,585
Gotta just keep yeah, keep with that left hand tension too, because that'll give you something to work against.

1171
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:49,270
brian: She's not getting anything because there's nothing to get.

1172
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,150
She's

1173
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:50,555
leah: okay.

1174
00:51:50,825 --> 00:51:51,065
All right.

1175
00:51:51,065 --> 00:51:52,115
So we should switch what we're doing then.

1176
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:53,105
Okay.

1177
00:51:53,495 --> 00:51:54,635
So now we can start, what Dr.

1178
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:57,545
George was saying would be our decision to score.

1179
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:57,650
Nice.

1180
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,090
There.

1181
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:58,250
Go.

1182
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,610
Yeah.

1183
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,370
That's a, that's

1184
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:00,365
nice.

1185
00:52:00,365 --> 00:52:00,875
Are here almost.

1186
00:52:00,965 --> 00:52:01,355
I think so.

1187
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,450
Let's look.

1188
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:02,460
Careful.

1189
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,201
So that's our careful, I wanna say because yeah, yeah.

1190
00:52:04,206 --> 00:52:04,710
You're doing it.

1191
00:52:04,715 --> 00:52:06,690
Looking at your looking where we were talking to.

1192
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:06,960
Okay.

1193
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,015
I think that's the, like ous coming down to that Arc Q.

1194
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,415
So I'm almost seeing this right here.

1195
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:15,870
Is that where you guys are seeing like that little lip there?

1196
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:16,200
Yeah.

1197
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,120
'
leah: cause that's where we're gonna want to get everything down.

1198
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,440
So I would come right here.

1199
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:19,980
brian: Okay.

1200
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,260
So see if I stretch what I would go slightly slower.

1201
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:22,290
Okay.

1202
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,680
And the reason is, I see this, see this right here and then an inflection point, right?

1203
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:25,815
Mm-hmm.

1204
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:27,000
That little, like you can see this.

1205
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,090
So if you imagine where base is, base is probably right there.

1206
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:30,335
Mm-hmm.

1207
00:52:30,785 --> 00:52:32,190
Right now let's look over here.

1208
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:34,000
Right.

1209
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,440
I don't see a lot over there to help us.

1210
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,279
That's gallbladder there.

1211
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:37,060
Gallbladder there.

1212
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:37,930
Don't know down there.

1213
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,069
So I would be aiming here because I know that there's gallbladder there.

1214
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,420
Right there.

1215
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,230
I can see it.

1216
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:44,529
Yep.

1217
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,640
Move your thing.

1218
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:47,830
Um, so there's gallbladder there.

1219
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,190
I know.

1220
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:48,970
I don't know what's there.

1221
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:50,830
So I wouldn't head down into nothing.

1222
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:51,700
I just scared.

1223
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:51,940
Right.

1224
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,049
So I'd head from there to there, which gives me right there, which is slightly lower than you guys.

1225
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:56,319
Slightly lower.

1226
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:56,890
So that's why.

1227
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:57,214
Okay.

1228
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:57,640
Got it.

1229
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:57,970
Okay.

1230
00:52:58,359 --> 00:52:59,734
leah: So I'd start right there.

1231
00:52:59,734 --> 00:53:00,375
Yeah, exactly.

1232
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:01,055
brian: Right

1233
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,174
there.

1234
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:02,410
brian: That might be a no in there.

1235
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,120
It's a weird spot for No, but it sure looks like that.

1236
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,420
Kind of looks

1237
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,649
leah: like a nerve right here.

1238
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,040
Yep.

1239
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,310
Sure.

1240
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:06,310
Yeah.

1241
00:53:06,325 --> 00:53:07,734
Just get through peritoneum.

1242
00:53:09,924 --> 00:53:10,214
Yeah.

1243
00:53:10,214 --> 00:53:13,180
So you'll just, boop zoo going, keep going through, through it.

1244
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:13,991
brian: There you go.

1245
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:14,375
One more.

1246
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:15,879
Oh, that's good.

1247
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:16,270
Alright.

1248
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:17,140
You're aiming for here?

1249
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:17,529
Yep.

1250
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:18,190
Not down there.

1251
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,330
leah: Nice.

1252
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,319
brian: Wiggle, pull

1253
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,140
leah: noise and then get back in your hole.

1254
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:24,370
brian: Yeah.

1255
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,080
You aim aiming, see how you're aiming down.

1256
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:26,589
Nice.

1257
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:26,975
You fix it.

1258
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:30,490
Seeing it, you, you, you angles this way needs to be like that.

1259
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:31,720
Okay.

1260
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,279
Because you're gonna go around the backside here.

1261
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:33,850
leah: Nice.

1262
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:39,910
brian: Sorry.

1263
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,259
Senior Resident: Nice.

1264
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,069
And make sure you thin it.

1265
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:43,060
Do the little sweeping.

1266
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:48,490
brian: The technique here is you turn it sideways, push in with the heel.

1267
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:49,060
Okay.

1268
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,250
Push in, dissect in, dissect in.

1269
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:51,940
Don't turn it yet.

1270
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:52,690
That's sharp.

1271
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:53,470
There you go.

1272
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:54,040
Push in.

1273
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,120
Push in in the plane.

1274
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:55,210
Okay.

1275
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:56,830
leah: Nice.

1276
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:56,830
Okay.

1277
00:53:56,836 --> 00:53:57,399
And then turn it

1278
00:53:58,299 --> 00:53:59,170
brian: and now sweep again.

1279
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:00,670
And if it rips, that's a good thing.

1280
00:54:02,485 --> 00:54:02,755
leah: Great.

1281
00:55:04,575 --> 00:55:05,595
Because you're looking over here.

1282
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:06,165
Is that one?

1283
00:55:06,195 --> 00:55:07,485
Oh, it's 'cause I was pointing at things.

1284
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:07,670
Okay.

1285
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:07,830
Yeah,

1286
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,550
brian: it's okay though.

1287
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:08,910
Yeah.

1288
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,310
Yeah.

1289
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:11,145
I took the light off of it because I thought it was disruptive.

1290
00:55:11,925 --> 00:55:12,225
I feel like

1291
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:16,125
this is super glar and I'm, I'm like a little nervous to like, you know what I mean?

1292
00:55:17,535 --> 00:55:18,015
I don't know Leah.

1293
00:55:18,134 --> 00:55:18,255
leah: No.

1294
00:55:18,255 --> 00:55:18,855
Yeah, you're good.

1295
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,345
I think you have one more lip you can take right there.

1296
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:22,755
I was thinking like this guy right here.

1297
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:23,325
Exactly.

1298
00:55:23,384 --> 00:55:23,685
leah: Yeah.

1299
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:24,134
Nice.

1300
00:55:25,935 --> 00:55:26,775
And just pull out.

1301
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:27,705
Nice.

1302
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:28,870
Bless you.

1303
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,240
Actually pretty good.

1304
00:55:36,404 --> 00:55:36,884
Yeah, it is.

1305
00:55:36,884 --> 00:55:38,080
I see your edge there, aren't we?

1306
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,240
I think,

1307
00:55:40,065 --> 00:55:40,185
leah: yeah.

1308
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:41,925
I think that's one more fat lip you can take right there.

1309
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:42,255
Cat.

1310
00:55:43,904 --> 00:55:44,654
Getting your heel back in.

1311
00:55:44,654 --> 00:55:45,555
That nice, that hole.

1312
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:46,035
Exactly.

1313
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:46,425
Perfect.

1314
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:52,440
Okay.

1315
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:59,580
Do you want to, um, pull your gallbladder medial and take a peek
at what you're seeing on this side of that dissection plane?

1316
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,270
Yeah.

1317
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:00,660
Nice.

1318
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,850
I think that, that you can come through that part right there.

1319
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,125
This stuff, right?

1320
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:04,380
Yeah.

1321
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:04,980
That schmutz.

1322
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:05,760
Yeah.

1323
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:07,980
Staying in that same plane

1324
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,690
brian: and saying high up on gallbladder.

1325
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,290
Push through the heel.

1326
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,550
Get some dissection.

1327
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:17,580
Yeah, because you, you freebie here, you're gonna be there anyway.

1328
00:56:17,585 --> 00:56:18,420
Yeah, yeah.

1329
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:18,930
Right there.

1330
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,170
Yeah.

1331
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:19,800
The base is here.

1332
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:21,540
That's somewhere else.

1333
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:21,690
Yeah.

1334
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:24,990
leah: And push through.

1335
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,180
Nice, nice.

1336
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,500
Take it again.

1337
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:28,890
Right there.

1338
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,550
You can tell that that's sch You can see that it's nothing behind it.

1339
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:33,210
Nice.

1340
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,420
brian: I'll stop for a second.

1341
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:36,570
Okay.

1342
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,580
So look to the right a little more please.

1343
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:42,930
So I'm imagining right there is base in that little blackness.

1344
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:42,990
Okay.

1345
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:43,650
I couldn't imagine.

1346
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,530
But the reason it looks like fullness coming down.

1347
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,830
We saw this here, like I think, I bet you there's nothing there.

1348
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:52,440
I mean, there's liver there eventually, right?

1349
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,700
That's the anatomy I'm seeing.

1350
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,300
leah: I agree.

1351
00:56:54,315 --> 00:56:55,320
brian: It, it looks like to me.

1352
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:55,590
leah: Yeah.

1353
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,540
brian: But I'm not totally sure what's going on over here.

1354
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,050
It looks,

1355
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,100
leah: no, I don't wanna go over there.

1356
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,160
I'm

1357
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,940
brian: not sure yet.

1358
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,990
No, I don't, I'm not saying avoid it.

1359
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,730
I'm just, I don't clarity yet.

1360
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:03,750
Right.

1361
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,800
We're talking about speed before.

1362
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,040
Exactly.

1363
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,670
Clear.

1364
00:57:05,675 --> 00:57:07,800
Understanding the anatomy is super fast, right?

1365
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,310
I mean, I slow down.

1366
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:08,430
What?

1367
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:08,820
I don't know.

1368
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,030
leah: Okay.

1369
00:57:37,005 --> 00:57:37,275
You got it.

1370
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:41,475
And just, if you're struggling, you can think about your left
hand and, and ask yourself, am I doing what I need with that?

1371
00:57:43,695 --> 00:57:43,905
Yeah.

1372
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:46,995
I think that's where you want to wanna get in right through that smudge.

1373
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,155
brian: So I want you to be aggressive.

1374
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:49,935
Stop for a second.

1375
00:57:51,315 --> 00:57:52,575
It's gonna be uncomfortable for you.

1376
00:57:52,665 --> 00:57:53,715
It's okay.

1377
00:57:54,765 --> 00:57:54,975
Okay.

1378
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:57,195
I want you to go into that plane that is all floppy there.

1379
00:57:57,615 --> 00:57:57,765
Yeah.

1380
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:04,635
I want you to go in solidly and I want you to not pull back as you turn, but actually almost push in as you're turning.

1381
00:58:04,665 --> 00:58:04,695
Okay.

1382
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:06,045
Try it out.

1383
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:07,155
Nope.

1384
00:58:07,245 --> 00:58:09,645
Start sideways like this.

1385
00:58:09,645 --> 00:58:10,275
And then like that.

1386
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:13,635
Like this, like this.

1387
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,015
You're like that right now.

1388
00:58:15,465 --> 00:58:16,665
You wanna be like that on the hook.

1389
00:58:17,685 --> 00:58:19,155
Push in with the heel like you were doing.

1390
00:58:19,155 --> 00:58:20,025
You're just doing this way.

1391
00:58:20,025 --> 00:58:20,685
Go right there.

1392
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:21,735
Push in.

1393
00:58:22,275 --> 00:58:22,875
Push in more.

1394
00:58:23,775 --> 00:58:26,445
Turn while you're pushing and it should pop through.

1395
00:58:26,865 --> 00:58:27,105
Okay.

1396
00:58:27,165 --> 00:58:27,615
That's it.

1397
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,375
Now you can wiggle it through if you want, but that's how you keep it hooked.

1398
00:58:30,945 --> 00:58:30,975
Okay.

1399
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:32,235
How it kept falling off of you.

1400
00:58:32,235 --> 00:58:36,900
'cause you were kind of like, like not quite like not in there, you know?

1401
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:37,935
And then

1402
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,675
leah: sort of pull as you take your move.

1403
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:40,575
Nice.

1404
00:58:41,805 --> 00:58:42,735
Coming in this way again.

1405
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,805
You actually go up.

1406
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:46,100
Yeah.

1407
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:46,515
brian: Yeah.

1408
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:46,700
Nice.

1409
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:47,985
Now you're talking.

1410
00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:49,845
Nice, nice, nice.

1411
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:51,285
Good job.

1412
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:56,205
leah: Yeah.

1413
00:58:56,235 --> 00:58:56,625
Nice.

1414
00:59:06,015 --> 00:59:07,215
Now you're just taking peritoneum.

1415
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:09,075
Yeah, sorry

1416
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,065
brian: about to get a liver.

1417
00:59:10,665 --> 00:59:11,145
Oh, okay.

1418
00:59:11,355 --> 00:59:11,625
leah: Alright.

1419
00:59:11,805 --> 00:59:12,225
I can see

1420
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:12,675
right there.

1421
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:19,425
leah: Sometimes we can you score peritoneum where we wanna just get our duct structures
if you want, if you want score, if it's given it to you, you can, whatever you want to do.

1422
00:59:19,665 --> 00:59:19,725
Yeah.

1423
00:59:19,725 --> 00:59:20,565
It's dealer choice.

1424
00:59:20,565 --> 00:59:23,205
I was thinking, I was thinking it's kind of giving us, if it is,

1425
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:24,285
brian: take it.

1426
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,810
Sweep sweep in that plane.

1427
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,650
They're trying to sweep it off.

1428
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,010
Nice.

1429
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,100
Yeah.

1430
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,490
I go with the.

1431
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,360
There actually.

1432
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,320
I know it's a, yeah, it's aggressive, but it's hard to get in heel there.

1433
00:59:48,325 --> 00:59:48,565
leah: Yeah.

1434
00:59:48,705 --> 00:59:51,320
And you can make pretty good progress with these scores.

1435
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:57,890
brian: The risk though, for you, the risk is it's getting the liver,
it's super easy to go on the hook and it folds over and you hook behind.

1436
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,700
This is gallbladder.

1437
00:59:59,540 --> 00:59:59,660
Mm-hmm.

1438
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,520
You have CISO here, you think you're in this plane and it, it
folds over and you actually get a, a nub and a gall bladder.

1439
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:04,670
Oh, gotcha.

1440
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,500
So that's the risk of hooking.

1441
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,900
leah: Just make, think about your uh, left hand too.

1442
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,590
If you're struggling.

1443
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,700
That's my usual thing.

1444
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,560
If I'm struggling, I'll say, what is my left doing?

1445
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,660
brian: Your left hand sabotaging you right now?

1446
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,610
leah: Because I think you're almost pushing it in.

1447
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:17,390
She's absolutely

1448
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:17,780
brian: pushing in.

1449
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,160
That crevice is her left hand.

1450
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:19,490
Yeah.

1451
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,080
Look the back digging with the camera.

1452
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,520
See where your left hand is.

1453
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:22,580
Yeah.

1454
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,165
You wanna be pulling it.

1455
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,340
See how you're making a hole there for yourself?

1456
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:25,910
Oh, sorry, cat.

1457
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,100
See that line?

1458
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,030
That's your left hand.

1459
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:29,900
Yeah.

1460
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,880
leah: From the grab it, pull straight out right

1461
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,195
brian: over and try and straighten it to this out more.

1462
01:00:35,195 --> 01:00:37,310
And it maybe just the wrong grab for you to get that corner

1463
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,660
leah: and if it is, we can always work somewhere else and then come back
to that with the new, grab a little lower and I'll free that part up.

1464
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:41,900
You know.

1465
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:42,350
Cool.

1466
01:00:44,605 --> 01:00:46,400
I think I, yeah, you can regrab.

1467
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,050
brian: Good job not slipping.

1468
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:52,340
leah: Yeah.

1469
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:58,760
Truly might be artery coming in on that, but Right in that I think is where artery is.

1470
01:00:58,765 --> 01:00:58,855
Okay.

1471
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:01,070
I think artery's gonna be right in there.

1472
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:01,580
Yeah.

1473
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:01,610
I

1474
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:04,190
brian: think we, I think it's hard to know for sure, but I think we saw it.

1475
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:04,580
leah: Yeah.

1476
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,050
Still tough.

1477
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:11,600
Um, but I think you can maybe get one more move here and if it's not working, we can go somewhere else.

1478
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:13,760
brian: The technique there was.

1479
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,100
You know your left hand when you're on this backside.

1480
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:16,670
Careful the liver.

1481
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:16,730
Yeah.

1482
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:17,090
Watch out.

1483
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:17,480
Yeah.

1484
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,140
Um, when your, um, left hand's in your own way.

1485
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:21,260
Mm-hmm.

1486
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,130
Your left hand.

1487
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:24,445
That's the principle she used.

1488
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:24,860
Okay.

1489
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,470
leah: If it's in your way, let's go somewhere else then if it's not working.

1490
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,780
So we started our dissection coming along here.

1491
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,320
We know we wanna angle back towards the liver, so let's start doing that part of the dissection.

1492
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:35,720
And we know arties somewhere in here, right?

1493
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,080
So we'll save super, um, superficial layer by layer and show it.

1494
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,540
And duct too is a posterior probably

1495
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:43,910
brian: do need.

1496
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:44,840
Yeah.

1497
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,300
The heel only works when you're on that way on the backside.

1498
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,370
That's a very specific technique to that.

1499
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:49,700
Okay.

1500
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,380
leah: And the thing I want to keep in mind is that we are twisting this fat a little.

1501
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,270
So when we come across, we don't wanna dig.

1502
01:01:56,395 --> 01:01:58,255
So just stay in nice and superficial there.

1503
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:00,865
brian: There you go.

1504
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:01,435
That's your point.

1505
01:02:01,435 --> 01:02:01,645
Yeah.

1506
01:02:01,645 --> 01:02:02,185
Nice.

1507
01:02:02,275 --> 01:02:03,259
leah: And just show it nice and thin.

1508
01:02:03,259 --> 01:02:03,420
Yeah.

1509
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:03,805
And see

1510
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:05,605
brian: I want to, so you can see your tip there, right?

1511
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:05,935
Yeah.

1512
01:02:06,025 --> 01:02:07,045
That's so meaningful.

1513
01:02:07,675 --> 01:02:08,035
It's beautiful.

1514
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:08,095
Is

1515
01:02:08,095 --> 01:02:10,615
that enough photos to it to like take it or That's it.

1516
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:10,780
brian: Yeah.

1517
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:11,425
Yeah.

1518
01:02:11,425 --> 01:02:11,815
Totally.

1519
01:02:12,115 --> 01:02:12,325
What, why?

1520
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:13,860
Sorry, I don't understand your question.

1521
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,060
Like

1522
01:02:14,245 --> 01:02:16,585
I just wanted to make sure that I saw enough and that it wasn't thin.

1523
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:17,395
It was thin enough.

1524
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:18,541
I was there that like, 'cause you

1525
01:02:18,546 --> 01:02:21,295
brian: also were going in and felt it and it wasn't thick, right?

1526
01:02:21,415 --> 01:02:22,375
No, it was very thin.

1527
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,325
So it's cool seeing it and feeling it.

1528
01:02:24,805 --> 01:02:24,925
leah: Yeah.

1529
01:02:24,925 --> 01:02:25,315
Get right.

1530
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:25,555
Yeah.

1531
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:26,815
That's a perfect plane right there.

1532
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,145
Nice.

1533
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:27,505
Good job.

1534
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:27,625
That's

1535
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,305
what I was saying is like, I felt like this.

1536
01:02:29,305 --> 01:02:30,115
Yeah, you had a little extra stuff

1537
01:02:30,115 --> 01:02:30,625
brian: but it was fine.

1538
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:32,965
You like where she's headed?

1539
01:02:33,325 --> 01:02:33,925
leah: Um,

1540
01:02:34,465 --> 01:02:34,735
almost.

1541
01:02:35,095 --> 01:02:35,455
brian: You get

1542
01:02:39,805 --> 01:02:40,134
leah: nice.

1543
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,600
Yeah, because I felt like before, like I said, I was just a little

1544
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,680
leah: Alright.

1545
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:48,505
And just think about how you're pulling, make sure your left is still helping you.

1546
01:02:49,745 --> 01:02:50,075
Nice.

1547
01:02:50,075 --> 01:02:51,095
That was a nice adjustment.

1548
01:02:51,095 --> 01:02:51,335
Coaching.

1549
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:03,305
She does have a bunch of dilated ducks, which we're thinking about, but we're safe here right now.

1550
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:04,115
brian: Very safe.

1551
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:08,525
It just feels stressful, but it's actually safe if you don't just like to talk about it to make me feel

1552
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:08,855
better.

1553
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,290
I feel like this is where I want.

1554
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,010
Yeah.

1555
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:13,210
There you

1556
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:13,250
brian: go.

1557
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:13,370
Yeah.

1558
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:13,530
Right there.

1559
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:13,890
Better?

1560
01:03:14,045 --> 01:03:14,225
Yeah.

1561
01:03:14,225 --> 01:03:15,875
We both want you to be inferior.

1562
01:03:15,935 --> 01:03:16,025
Yeah.

1563
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:16,475
Right there.

1564
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:17,405
Perfect.

1565
01:03:17,735 --> 01:03:18,155
leah: Yeah.

1566
01:03:18,155 --> 01:03:18,845
Nice job, Kat.

1567
01:03:19,385 --> 01:03:19,535
brian: Yep.

1568
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,195
All safe here.

1569
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:20,945
You can see through it.

1570
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:26,225
Even if there was a pad vein deep to you or some horrible thing you don't want to touch, you're safe here.

1571
01:03:27,305 --> 01:03:28,085
Especially when you sweep.

1572
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:28,530
Yeah.

1573
01:03:31,685 --> 01:03:32,405
That's your faucet.

1574
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:33,665
She's, that's the faucet.

1575
01:03:33,665 --> 01:03:34,985
It's right there.

1576
01:03:35,735 --> 01:03:39,725
See how it, everything's like the, all the surfaces are going into that point there.

1577
01:03:39,725 --> 01:03:40,115
That's it.

1578
01:03:40,535 --> 01:03:42,245
The base of the gallbladder is gonna be right here.

1579
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:43,745
Okay.

1580
01:03:43,835 --> 01:03:44,045
Mm-hmm.

1581
01:03:44,051 --> 01:03:45,650
Because you can see the, yeah.

1582
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:45,651
Yeah.

1583
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:46,085
I can see it.

1584
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:46,290
Yeah.

1585
01:03:46,295 --> 01:03:46,595
Yeah, yeah.

1586
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:48,875
So she's almost, you get one more move and you're perfect.

1587
01:03:49,085 --> 01:03:49,325
Yeah.

1588
01:03:49,415 --> 01:03:49,775
leah: Nice.

1589
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,225
brian: You know,

1590
01:03:50,795 --> 01:03:51,065
leah: sweep.

1591
01:03:51,065 --> 01:03:53,890
Sweep and just think about how you More aggressive.

1592
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:54,335
Yeah.

1593
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:54,905
Pull this more

1594
01:03:55,355 --> 01:03:57,290
brian: finger sweeps and sweep up.

1595
01:03:59,260 --> 01:03:59,550
Nice.

1596
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,515
And make sure you see it.

1597
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:02,615
This is definitely territory.

1598
01:04:02,615 --> 01:04:02,915
Yeah.

1599
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:03,156
There you go.

1600
01:04:05,255 --> 01:04:06,185
leah: Use your left hand.

1601
01:04:06,185 --> 01:04:06,430
There you go.

1602
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:09,590
You're good.

1603
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:10,340
It's okay.

1604
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,930
Just watch your Bovie.

1605
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:14,480
brian: Is that a purposeful move or accidental?

1606
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:14,810
That was

1607
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:15,200
accidental.

1608
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:15,830
That was my fault.

1609
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:17,810
brian: Luckily it was actually productive.

1610
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,430
'cause you were kind of dissecting everything up.

1611
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,290
leah: I think you have one more move going posterior.

1612
01:04:25,285 --> 01:04:25,575
Yeah.

1613
01:04:26,275 --> 01:04:27,575
brian: You can't see the tension on it.

1614
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:28,250
Yeah, exactly.

1615
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,935
Yeah, that's the, that's really good.

1616
01:04:31,745 --> 01:04:32,655
Maybe it takes more than one.

1617
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,470
Yeah, maybe one more.

1618
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:34,730
leah: Nice.

1619
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:35,270
Yeah, perfect.

1620
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:38,455
Right in that whole, and we'll just pull carefully so we don't whack the little off.

1621
01:04:38,455 --> 01:04:38,655
That's

1622
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,110
brian: little thick, right?

1623
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,070
But there's nothing there.

1624
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:41,240
It doesn't move like it's anything.

1625
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,080
So I would take it

1626
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:45,080
be very careful.

1627
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,520
brian: This last one I wanna think about.

1628
01:04:49,525 --> 01:04:50,660
That's, yeah, I think that's good.

1629
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,980
I think we're good.

1630
01:04:51,985 --> 01:04:53,270
You can't go up but I think you're a little deep.

1631
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,260
Yeah, that's how

1632
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:55,190
brian: I know.

1633
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:57,290
Just try and come in with the camera for her.

1634
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:57,650
leah: Yeah.

1635
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,480
There's that top lip where that's

1636
01:04:59,480 --> 01:04:59,690
what I

1637
01:04:59,690 --> 01:04:59,780
brian: was.

1638
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:00,470
Yeah.

1639
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,510
You gotta be deep that vessel once you get there.

1640
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:02,750
Okay.

1641
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:03,290
Exactly.

1642
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:04,640
leah: And you can do that.

1643
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,590
Good sweep and dissection here that you've been doing.

1644
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:07,760
Yeah.

1645
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,210
Nice.

1646
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:11,450
brian: Yeah.

1647
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:12,765
Maybe just take that whole thing.

1648
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:14,595
I dunno.

1649
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,580
Just don't go halfway across that vessel.

1650
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,630
That's all I really care about.

1651
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,120
If you're gonna go deep to it.

1652
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:20,720
Yeah, that's good.

1653
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,450
Don't pull hard when you're moving up because you'll it before.

1654
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:23,990
It cooks.

1655
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,100
Some good buzzes through.

1656
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:25,555
It's good.

1657
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,480
You pulled too hard.

1658
01:05:28,385 --> 01:05:28,565
Okay.

1659
01:05:29,735 --> 01:05:33,320
Get it rip before you problem,

1660
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,120
leah: because

1661
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,760
brian: that's really important part to be able to see.

1662
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,555
Yeah, I wouldn't keep pushing into it just a little bit here.

1663
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:39,515
Don't burn there again.

1664
01:05:39,785 --> 01:05:40,505
Where we're right here.

1665
01:05:41,825 --> 01:05:42,480
No on top of it

1666
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:46,480
because that's.

1667
01:05:50,445 --> 01:05:50,685
leah: Okay.

1668
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:52,665
Do you wanna come up this lip here?

1669
01:05:52,665 --> 01:05:54,045
Or we can keep working back there.

1670
01:05:54,465 --> 01:05:54,975
brian: What do you wanna do?

1671
01:05:56,295 --> 01:06:01,210
I almost feel like it's kind of coming up a little bit this way, but I wanna see how it, like with the, okay.

1672
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,170
And if it's, I guess.

1673
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:11,135
She's good.

1674
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:11,705
leah: Yeah.

1675
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:12,290
There we go.

1676
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:14,255
Nice.

1677
01:06:14,315 --> 01:06:15,725
Give a good pull with that left.

1678
01:06:16,835 --> 01:06:17,495
Nice.

1679
01:06:21,455 --> 01:06:21,755
Nice.

1680
01:06:22,655 --> 01:06:23,255
brian: That's really good.

1681
01:06:23,345 --> 01:06:23,525
Yeah.

1682
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:25,265
So principal here, you guys, both of you.

1683
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,570
Mm-hmm.

1684
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:29,945
So you know you don't wanna be burning when it's touching the
gallbladder 'cause you make a hole in the gallbladder, right?

1685
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:30,130
Mm-hmm.

1686
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:30,690
Okay.

1687
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:33,965
But you don't wanna pull super hard 'cause you want to coagulate vessels before they rip.

1688
01:06:33,965 --> 01:06:34,145
Yeah.

1689
01:06:34,145 --> 01:06:35,285
That's where I feel like I, so there's a tension.

1690
01:06:35,345 --> 01:06:35,435
Mm-hmm.

1691
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:41,765
The way you reconcile that is you go in, you sweep, so you have auto
mobility to get it away from gallbladder without having to pull hard.

1692
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:42,455
Mm-hmm.

1693
01:06:42,515 --> 01:06:42,695
brian: Okay.

1694
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:49,865
So that's why I'm sweeping is I'm developing the plane so that I can
kind of pull just enough to get the hook off the gallbladder but no more.

1695
01:06:50,015 --> 01:06:50,255
Got it.

1696
01:06:50,255 --> 01:06:50,765
Nice.

1697
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:50,970
Okay.

1698
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,745
Like this kind of where we're sitting here.

1699
01:06:53,045 --> 01:06:53,405
brian: Sure.

1700
01:06:53,525 --> 01:06:54,065
That looks better.

1701
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:54,905
Let's see if it cooks.

1702
01:06:54,905 --> 01:06:55,115
Yeah.

1703
01:06:55,115 --> 01:06:55,445
That looks better.

1704
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:55,925
Right?

1705
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:55,985
Yeah.

1706
01:06:55,985 --> 01:06:55,986
Nice.

1707
01:06:56,015 --> 01:07:00,185
It took about half second to come through and then, and it's really important with vessels, right?

1708
01:07:00,185 --> 01:07:01,535
Because you can't pull hard on those.

1709
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:02,285
Yeah.

1710
01:07:04,295 --> 01:07:04,775
brian: Left hand.

1711
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:05,975
Is your left helping you or hurting?

1712
01:07:05,975 --> 01:07:06,155
Yeah.

1713
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,415
Figure out how to, with my left.

1714
01:07:07,415 --> 01:07:07,960
How to pull better

1715
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,080
brian: out.

1716
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,155
You may just be running out of it.

1717
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:09,575
I think

1718
01:07:09,575 --> 01:07:10,145
leah: we're running out.

1719
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,435
Yeah, if we're running out, let's come back down.

1720
01:07:12,215 --> 01:07:12,425
brian: Okay.

1721
01:07:12,425 --> 01:07:12,875
Next step.

1722
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:15,155
So get this there if you don't mind.

1723
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:17,645
So yeah, next step is actually not quite that.

1724
01:07:17,795 --> 01:07:20,825
Um, it's gonna be not, yeah, I would probably

1725
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:23,165
leah: turn my, like that come underneath.

1726
01:07:23,345 --> 01:07:24,275
Come on This side of it.

1727
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,885
This guy right here?

1728
01:07:26,975 --> 01:07:28,445
Yeah, but I, yeah, that's fine.

1729
01:07:28,955 --> 01:07:29,615
Slide it down.

1730
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:32,825
leah: There may be node right around it or duct.

1731
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,205
She has dilated ducts.

1732
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:34,207
Get some.

1733
01:07:34,445 --> 01:07:35,075
brian: Weird thing though.

1734
01:07:35,075 --> 01:07:37,730
It almost looks like there's a plane here to move the way it moved.

1735
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:39,210
Looks like a note or something like it.

1736
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:42,815
Does it look like an So see how that moves independently of this?

1737
01:07:42,815 --> 01:07:43,955
When you touch it, touch it again.

1738
01:07:44,705 --> 01:07:45,575
See Yeah.

1739
01:07:45,575 --> 01:07:45,875
Move.

1740
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:46,085
Right.

1741
01:07:46,085 --> 01:07:46,985
This doesn't move at all.

1742
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:47,345
No.

1743
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:48,905
So it suggests to me there's a plane there.

1744
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:49,055
Yeah.

1745
01:07:49,115 --> 01:07:49,445
Okay.

1746
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:55,295
Now just be careful 'cause now what you actually want to do though is you have a peritoneal covering here with leaflet.

1747
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:55,535
Mm-hmm.

1748
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,015
Okay.

1749
01:07:56,525 --> 01:07:59,495
What you wanna do is actually grab that and just peel it back.

1750
01:07:59,555 --> 01:07:59,825
Yeah.

1751
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:00,065
Perfect.

1752
01:08:00,065 --> 01:08:06,545
It's the most efficient way to just expose that space and then you're
gonna be left the fat structures and peritoneal on the other side.

1753
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:06,845
leah: Perfect.

1754
01:08:07,265 --> 01:08:07,565
brian: Okay.

1755
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:08,915
leah: Marilyn to pull or

1756
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:09,515
brian: That's what I use.

1757
01:08:09,515 --> 01:08:09,665
Yeah.

1758
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:11,825
'cause it's curved or right angle.

1759
01:08:12,335 --> 01:08:13,835
'cause you want to grab a broad base.

1760
01:08:13,835 --> 01:08:15,545
You don't want to grab a little bit of it Exactly right.

1761
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:15,890
Because it'll rip.

1762
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:16,130
Right.

1763
01:08:16,205 --> 01:08:16,385
And

1764
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:19,446
leah: then, and then ka The thing to think about is Maryland, Marilyn.

1765
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:19,835
Yeah.

1766
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:20,944
Is how you're pulling.

1767
01:08:20,944 --> 01:08:23,975
'cause you're gonna pull in the direction of the tissue, like the plane.

1768
01:08:24,785 --> 01:08:25,865
And that way it should pull easy.

1769
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:28,175
Just like if you were doing open surgery.

1770
01:08:28,175 --> 01:08:30,904
The same sort of tension principles.

1771
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:31,507
brian: So guys, yeah.

1772
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:31,509
Do this.

1773
01:08:31,514 --> 01:08:32,465
Let's have her do this.

1774
01:08:32,465 --> 01:08:33,360
And I don't wanna talk about time

1775
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,520
and then we, because I remember we wanted to talk,

1776
01:08:35,585 --> 01:08:35,944
brian: clip it.

1777
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:39,245
Um, so you can get a along one tie on that side of the plane.

1778
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,319
One tie on another side of the plane.

1779
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,321
Yeah.

1780
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:40,775
Nice.

1781
01:08:41,105 --> 01:08:41,915
And then I remember we like

1782
01:08:41,915 --> 01:08:48,365
leah: wanted a little more like, like this so that you're like grabbing
like that, like that and pulling across a broad base of your instrument.

1783
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:57,095
And then I remember having a little piece of, a little bit, almost like in the crotch, Dr. George, say
again, like you had almost a little bit of it going towards like the crotch of the Maryland a little bit.

1784
01:08:57,154 --> 01:08:58,415
brian: Uh, as much as you can get.

1785
01:08:58,415 --> 01:08:59,404
It doesn't matter where.

1786
01:08:59,410 --> 01:08:59,480
Yeah.

1787
01:08:59,615 --> 01:09:01,400
It's as big as you want because physics where it's dripping.

1788
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,855
If it's plane, you keep going.

1789
01:09:02,855 --> 01:09:03,725
leah: If not, I see.

1790
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:04,080
Don't, yeah.

1791
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:06,609
That's a really productive one.

1792
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:07,290
leah: Yeah, it was.

1793
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:08,170
I was just

1794
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,109
gonna be a little smaller.

1795
01:09:10,264 --> 01:09:10,564
Yeah.

1796
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:10,625
Out.

1797
01:09:11,825 --> 01:09:14,795
leah: Sometimes when you gr grab just a little bit, you pull and it bleeds.

1798
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,104
So if you can spread the tension out across more tissue, where

1799
01:09:17,585 --> 01:09:19,054
brian: did ripped, I dunno if you noticed it ripped in the fat out of the plane.

1800
01:09:19,115 --> 01:09:19,625
Exactly.

1801
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:19,894
Yeah.

1802
01:09:21,165 --> 01:09:22,425
Grouping the fat, not the plane.

1803
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,545
I'm trying to figure out if I wanna, because I wanna be in this.

1804
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:26,115
Not yet.

1805
01:09:26,145 --> 01:09:26,925
No, not there yet.

1806
01:09:26,925 --> 01:09:27,285
The step here is

1807
01:09:27,285 --> 01:09:28,815
brian: take this peritoneal stuff down.

1808
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:29,505
That's all you're doing.

1809
01:09:29,925 --> 01:09:31,275
You're all the way over to the fossa.

1810
01:09:31,905 --> 01:09:32,055
So

1811
01:09:32,055 --> 01:09:33,075
brian: this stuff here, then that's enough.

1812
01:09:33,075 --> 01:09:33,795
You don't need more there.

1813
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:35,625
It's this stuff up here that you care about.

1814
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:36,435
leah: Okay.

1815
01:09:36,435 --> 01:09:39,345
And you can pull your left hand at a slightly different angle to fix that.

1816
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:39,735
Yeah.

1817
01:09:39,735 --> 01:09:40,125
Nice

1818
01:09:40,365 --> 01:09:40,935
to get this.

1819
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,975
So we're going with this, this stuff right here?

1820
01:09:43,215 --> 01:09:43,395
Yeah.

1821
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:46,365
leah: And you can, there looks to be a lip up here that I would try to grab.

1822
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:51,015
brian: The reason I have Q-tips is I go to point and then I get my finger dirty and I gotta change my gloves.

1823
01:09:51,015 --> 01:09:51,795
I'll take a Q-tip.

1824
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:54,225
leah: I am a pointer apparently.

1825
01:09:54,225 --> 01:09:54,375
That's

1826
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:54,945
brian: why I do it.

1827
01:09:55,545 --> 01:09:56,085
Oh no.

1828
01:09:56,085 --> 01:09:57,780
For laparoscopy, it's way, way better.

1829
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:58,140
Okay.

1830
01:09:59,175 --> 01:09:59,505
Yeah.

1831
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:02,025
leah: Yeah, I should.

1832
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:02,474
Yeah.

1833
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:05,625
No, you're doing good.

1834
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:05,985
Pulls

1835
01:10:08,655 --> 01:10:17,865
brian: well with this technology is you can look and, and I just, I think the future is, I'm gonna be able
this look where I'm looking and, and have it show on their screen and I wouldn't pull back there anymore.

1836
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:19,035
So I think it's gonna happen.

1837
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:19,365
Yeah.

1838
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:21,945
So what I wanna do is I wanna get where AI will show you.

1839
01:10:21,945 --> 01:10:22,700
Yeah, yeah.

1840
01:10:22,995 --> 01:10:28,724
leah: Dr. George for, for this next step, um, we still have more, we
need to clean off here and we need to get our posterior cleaned off.

1841
01:10:28,965 --> 01:10:30,405
brian: I wouldn't worry about the posterior yet.

1842
01:10:30,405 --> 01:10:30,420
Not yet.

1843
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:30,795
Okay.

1844
01:10:30,795 --> 01:10:32,295
And sometimes you don't have to worry about it at all.

1845
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:32,540
Okay.

1846
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,775
So, so you see that's smooth here.

1847
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,525
That's smooth.

1848
01:10:36,974 --> 01:10:37,934
See, it's rough all here.

1849
01:10:38,295 --> 01:10:38,535
Yeah.

1850
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:39,014
It's

1851
01:10:39,014 --> 01:10:41,235
brian: the smooth, which is peritoneum and it needs to come down.

1852
01:10:41,715 --> 01:10:41,745
Okay.

1853
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:44,474
The only thing I wanna point out to you see how it looks like there's a band here?

1854
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:44,925
Yeah.

1855
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:47,894
Why do you think there's a band holding, uh, the peritoneum up

1856
01:10:48,585 --> 01:10:49,035
Right here?

1857
01:10:49,035 --> 01:10:49,095
Yeah.

1858
01:10:49,095 --> 01:10:55,220
Um, 'cause of like the, um, 'cause I didn't go through like the per for it or

1859
01:10:55,905 --> 01:10:58,095
brian: why do you think there's a band holding the peritoneum up there?

1860
01:10:58,965 --> 01:10:59,985
Are you talking about structures in it?

1861
01:10:59,985 --> 01:11:03,255
I will you tell me why is this trung up?

1862
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:07,920
Oh, because of the weight of the, um, anatomy's actually formed.

1863
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:08,835
There's an artery under it.

1864
01:11:08,835 --> 01:11:08,955
Yeah.

1865
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,639
brian: It's guaranteed.

1866
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:10,080
Yeah.

1867
01:11:10,635 --> 01:11:11,625
It's holding everything up.

1868
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:15,080
Ductal s you stretch your left hand out, it's just the artery like here and it goes dway.

1869
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:16,480
Okay.

1870
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:17,955
So there's an artery there, which is great.

1871
01:11:17,985 --> 01:11:18,795
You wanna expose it.

1872
01:11:18,795 --> 01:11:21,825
So if you grab the perone over the top of it, you'll actually start to see it.

1873
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:23,120
Okay,

1874
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:23,400
brian: cool.

1875
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,500
Look right here.

1876
01:11:25,505 --> 01:11:25,575
Yeah.

1877
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:25,860
You keep

1878
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,370
brian: going there.

1879
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,060
I want you up there.

1880
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:31,920
Yeah, so like Right that, but uh, hard to do it that way, but you can try

1881
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,010
trying to take a bigger bite.

1882
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:35,940
Don't grab the artery.

1883
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:36,660
Yeah, I know.

1884
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,160
I'm trying to think about how, yeah, yeah.

1885
01:11:38,165 --> 01:11:38,850
And you just saw it.

1886
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:42,735
It's pretty shitty, but I know I'm just little bigger about how to get at, how to hold it, but like,

1887
01:11:43,085 --> 01:11:43,375
brian: okay.

1888
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:44,520
Don't get too aggressive.

1889
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:45,450
Don't get greedy.

1890
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,470
Get what you get and then stop and re recalibrate.

1891
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:49,950
There you go.

1892
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:50,310
That's it.

1893
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:55,770
Now you're doing, so this is a really fast way to, to skeletonize ductal structures in the cystic triangle.

1894
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:56,430
Okay.

1895
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:56,431
Okay.

1896
01:11:56,436 --> 01:11:56,655
Okay.

1897
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,340
There's a couple more techniques that help this too, but

1898
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,750
a weak sauce.

1899
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,960
There's a Please.

1900
01:12:07,215 --> 01:12:09,750
leah: I was gonna say, I think that there's a tension plane here you could pull, but.

1901
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:10,535
Try it.

1902
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:13,805
Pull on it or, yeah, right here.

1903
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:18,425
That was a good problem.

1904
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:19,355
Perfect.

1905
01:12:19,805 --> 01:12:19,985
brian: Okay.

1906
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:23,255
There's another technique, kind of the roll technique for grabbing this technique.

1907
01:12:23,345 --> 01:12:26,465
You want this in your, in your thing, but you want to garage base.

1908
01:12:26,465 --> 01:12:29,765
So what you gonna do is you're gonna take your time, you're gonna push in and then push that way.

1909
01:12:29,765 --> 01:12:33,095
Actually it'll bring that up into your, into your instrument.

1910
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:37,655
We're trying to get that numb in instrument.

1911
01:12:37,685 --> 01:12:38,225
That's it.

1912
01:12:38,735 --> 01:12:39,515
And then grab it.

1913
01:12:40,685 --> 01:12:41,045
Okay.

1914
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:42,995
And I don't think your tips grabbing anything else.

1915
01:12:42,995 --> 01:12:44,285
And I'll try and rip down.

1916
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:45,965
So not quite big enough.

1917
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:48,185
So you're gonna have a little farther past to do that same move.

1918
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:49,385
It's hard.

1919
01:12:50,555 --> 01:12:50,915
That's it.

1920
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:51,485
That'll work.

1921
01:12:52,775 --> 01:12:53,165
Should work.

1922
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:53,345
Yep.

1923
01:12:53,345 --> 01:12:53,795
Keep going.

1924
01:12:55,415 --> 01:12:56,675
It didn't, but we see an there.

1925
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:57,310
Yeah.

1926
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:57,965
Yeah, for sure.

1927
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,155
Okay, so now you got a little more.

1928
01:13:00,155 --> 01:13:01,445
What do you wanna do next, Leo?

1929
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:04,295
leah: Um, well I think that this can come down here.

1930
01:13:04,295 --> 01:13:04,415
Agree.

1931
01:13:05,075 --> 01:13:06,335
Because when you pull it, I saw that.

1932
01:13:07,655 --> 01:13:10,535
So it's like, yeah, this grabbed here and pulled.

1933
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:11,465
brian: Big bite of it.

1934
01:13:11,675 --> 01:13:11,945
Yeah.

1935
01:13:12,065 --> 01:13:12,755
Big bite of it.

1936
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:13,895
It's all weak fat.

1937
01:13:14,345 --> 01:13:14,915
Your plane's right?

1938
01:13:14,945 --> 01:13:15,155
Nope.

1939
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:16,385
You grabbed off plane one.

1940
01:13:16,445 --> 01:13:17,795
This is your plane this time.

1941
01:13:17,795 --> 01:13:18,455
Above the plane.

1942
01:13:18,455 --> 01:13:18,935
This time.

1943
01:13:18,935 --> 01:13:19,445
Below the plane.

1944
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:21,725
That's your plane right there.

1945
01:13:25,445 --> 01:13:25,830
That's it.

1946
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:28,440
leah: Nice.

1947
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:28,679
Good job.

1948
01:13:28,715 --> 01:13:28,934
Ka

1949
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,235
Like the plane is,

1950
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,889
brian: that's your plane right

1951
01:13:34,889 --> 01:13:35,130
there.

1952
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,035
So you wanna go above?

1953
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:37,075
Yeah, but

1954
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:39,150
brian: put your, set that time just above the plane

1955
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:41,099
and push in

1956
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:42,660
brian: and then grab.

1957
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:43,380
That's it.

1958
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:44,010
That's the move.

1959
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:47,519
That's the most efficient way of dissecting a plane.

1960
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:48,540
Oh, beautiful pool right there.

1961
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:48,809
Nice.

1962
01:13:49,139 --> 01:13:50,580
leah: That's probably as much as it's gonna give you there.

1963
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:51,870
Okay.

1964
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:52,019
I'm

1965
01:13:52,019 --> 01:13:53,070
brian: still seeing gallbladder there.

1966
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:54,719
I know, I, it's kind of weird, huh?

1967
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,195
leah: I'm wondering if we could thin and come across the anterior to it.

1968
01:13:59,195 --> 01:13:59,434
Yeah.

1969
01:14:00,385 --> 01:14:01,035
brian: What the hell's going on?

1970
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:02,115
I just still don't understand the anatomy.

1971
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:02,474
Yeah.

1972
01:14:06,054 --> 01:14:09,179
So it feels weird because it looks like, I feel like I still see stuff going like right here.

1973
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:09,955
Is that what you guys are talking?

1974
01:14:09,965 --> 01:14:10,315
Maybe?

1975
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:10,980
Yeah, I think that might be

1976
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,030
brian: gallbladder, but who knows?

1977
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:12,450
It's weird.

1978
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,170
Oh, okay.

1979
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,219
I'm gonna ask you guys to switch.

1980
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,170
I'm only gonna do it 'cause we were doing this for two hours now.

1981
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:16,830
Yeah.

1982
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:16,831
Okay.

1983
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:21,870
Oh, and I don't think we need to be through the cystic di dissection hour though, actually.

1984
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:22,125
Right.

1985
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:22,889
For an easy one.

1986
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,860
So hopefully you feel like you've gotten enough learning.

1987
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:26,580
I got, yeah, I got good.

1988
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:27,000
Okay.

1989
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:27,990
Why Don you guys switch?

1990
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,260
I'm not at all.

1991
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:28,679
I promise.

1992
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:29,429
Today was very great.

1993
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:29,790
Thank you.

1994
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:30,059
brian: Yeah.

1995
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,620
And some that was Rich.

1996
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:33,389
Can't learn everything in one session.

1997
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:33,960
No.

1998
01:14:34,889 --> 01:14:35,639
While you guys are switching.

1999
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,240
So yeah, this hasn't touched anything yet.

2000
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:39,540
Nope.

2001
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:39,809
Okay.

2002
01:14:39,815 --> 01:14:40,740
I was good about it.

2003
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,160
Okay.

2004
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,540
Just wanna make sure I set down

2005
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:48,630
leah: again.

2006
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:49,530
Here's this little guy.

2007
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:51,240
brian: Thanks.

2008
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:52,135
Good job.

2009
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:56,185
leah: Yeah, you did really far.

2010
01:14:58,045 --> 01:14:58,945
Very good tip.

2011
01:14:59,185 --> 01:15:00,960
Are good technical learning for you?

2012
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,240
I had really good coaching.

2013
01:15:04,765 --> 01:15:04,975
leah: Oh,

2014
01:15:04,975 --> 01:15:05,275
brian: sweet.

2015
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:05,545
Really good.

2016
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:07,075
It's all these little minutes.

2017
01:15:07,075 --> 01:15:07,405
Thank you.

2018
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,515
You know that you, when you're learning mind if I get a

2019
01:15:11,515 --> 01:15:12,415
leah: step over here

2020
01:15:12,565 --> 01:15:12,895
brian: continue.

2021
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:14,600
Exactly.

2022
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:16,525
leah: Exactly.

2023
01:15:18,385 --> 01:15:18,655
Yeah.

2024
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:23,065
Okay.

2025
01:15:24,055 --> 01:15:25,375
My, that's interesting.

2026
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:25,615
Yeah.

2027
01:15:25,615 --> 01:15:26,845
I think that that very weird.

2028
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,990
It's gotta be, I think

2029
01:15:28,015 --> 01:15:28,885
brian: that's in particular.

2030
01:15:28,945 --> 01:15:29,305
Yeah.

2031
01:15:29,695 --> 01:15:32,635
I'm gonna regrab just 'cause it has a double arc. One on these side.

2032
01:15:32,635 --> 01:15:34,991
You know what's going on with this, but I

2033
01:15:34,996 --> 01:15:35,845
feel like I learned a lot.

2034
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:36,565
Thank you guys.

2035
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:37,585
There we go.

2036
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:38,155
It's

2037
01:15:38,155 --> 01:15:39,655
brian: important for your future patients.

2038
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:42,350
Yeah.

2039
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,480
Yeah.

2040
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:44,800
Oh, thank you.

2041
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:45,550
Oh, I see.

2042
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:49,900
So I think you're gonna, yeah, generally speaking, I find it y at this phase.

2043
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:50,200
Thank you.

2044
01:15:51,519 --> 01:15:51,880
Okay.

2045
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:55,720
Honestly, because the reason is you want to put the cystic duct on scratch.

2046
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,470
Oh, my bad.

2047
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:57,790
leah: Yeah, I agree.

2048
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,150
I'm gonna, I'm gonna tint with my right and then regrab it, my left.

2049
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,050
Thank you.

2050
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:11,830
You came in before you kind of like came in, rolled it, and then moved
it on the in field before when we were doing the other, um, lady talking.

2051
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:12,730
Yeah.

2052
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:16,180
Is this kind of where you were talking about where you pushed it in and you rolled it and we pushed a little

2053
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,769
leah: back, uh, with the, your hand cat.

2054
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:22,795
brian: We, right now we we're gonna grab below the artery, typically.

2055
01:16:22,905 --> 01:16:23,680
leah: Will you come in dig?

2056
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:23,800
Yep.

2057
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:27,610
Just trying to see exactly where I wanna grab, I think lower.

2058
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:27,975
Yeah, yeah,

2059
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,250
brian: yeah, exactly.

2060
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:31,480
See what that gives you.

2061
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,610
Then we push a, a hair more cat on.

2062
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:34,480
Yeah.

2063
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,710
leah: Are you not able to push back more with your Yeah.

2064
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,010
Okay.

2065
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:40,090
Is that okay?

2066
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:40,540
leah: Yeah.

2067
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:41,200
Yeah.

2068
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,460
I'm not super convinced by that.

2069
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:42,790
Let's,

2070
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,670
brian: so Ken, your job is to push the edge.

2071
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,900
That's how you know you pushed it up.

2072
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:50,680
Yeah.

2073
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:55,301
It's not ripping off and you elevated all the cystic stuff out of the.

2074
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:58,325
The fsa, but not so much.

2075
01:16:58,325 --> 01:16:59,345
The liver folded over.

2076
01:16:59,345 --> 01:16:59,465
Nice.

2077
01:17:00,185 --> 01:17:03,755
So you're gonna experiment with those three variables, you to see which one is best for her.

2078
01:17:04,085 --> 01:17:06,155
leah: Let's take a peek exactly what we think is going on.

2079
01:17:07,955 --> 01:17:08,555
What do we think?

2080
01:17:08,555 --> 01:17:09,275
What do we think?

2081
01:17:09,545 --> 01:17:10,715
It's hard to tell actually.

2082
01:17:10,715 --> 01:17:11,315
Super hard to tell.

2083
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,285
Oops, sticky.

2084
01:17:15,575 --> 01:17:21,815
I just wanna make sure we're thinking correctly about where her infundibulum is good, because she has dilated ducts.

2085
01:17:21,815 --> 01:17:24,815
So I don't wanna get, you know, confused and go too low.

2086
01:17:25,115 --> 01:17:26,285
Here's our sulcus of per se.

2087
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:30,065
Above that, I mean, maybe I'll take some of this.

2088
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:32,525
I don't know if we need to, but if we take some of this down.

2089
01:17:34,195 --> 01:17:35,125
What do you think, Dr. George?

2090
01:17:35,575 --> 01:17:39,085
brian: So I would actually, uh, I pull everything out so I can see.

2091
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,594
leah: Now it's like, is this node

2092
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:47,214
brian: sure, maybe I don't know.

2093
01:17:47,214 --> 01:17:49,045
Or is this, I don't know.

2094
01:17:49,045 --> 01:17:49,048
I don't know.

2095
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:50,035
So where it's safe.

2096
01:17:50,035 --> 01:17:50,455
So where is it?

2097
01:17:50,455 --> 01:17:50,754
Safe?

2098
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:53,785
leah: Well, safe technically is higher and posterior.

2099
01:17:53,785 --> 01:17:54,745
We that those are safe.

2100
01:17:55,014 --> 01:17:56,995
brian: Yeah, there's, there's several Parents are safe shortly.

2101
01:17:56,995 --> 01:17:58,045
You can go there if you wanted it.

2102
01:17:59,035 --> 01:18:03,445
Or you can go medially this, this fat, you know, you could start to bring that fat down too.

2103
01:18:04,105 --> 01:18:04,134
Okay.

2104
01:18:04,134 --> 01:18:04,884
That's gonna be safe.

2105
01:18:04,884 --> 01:18:06,535
As long as you're careful, right?

2106
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:17,125
You don't want, this is not where you aggressively engaged and
instrument can really see what goes and then feel around in there.

2107
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:17,964
Feel free to fill the doc.

2108
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:21,009
And we don't know our base is, no I don't.

2109
01:18:21,009 --> 01:18:25,089
So we think our pops to either their note or it or it's a Right, right.

2110
01:18:25,315 --> 01:18:28,554
But if it's, if it's, it's in the base is gonna be there.

2111
01:18:29,035 --> 01:18:30,085
So I wouldn't spread up there.

2112
01:18:30,115 --> 01:18:30,745
'cause that could be dull.

2113
01:18:31,105 --> 01:18:31,974
leah: I think it might be.

2114
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:32,304
Yeah.

2115
01:18:33,085 --> 01:18:34,705
brian: So this is nice fast cat here.

2116
01:18:34,705 --> 01:18:35,785
We saw the artery earlier.

2117
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:36,985
Where was that?

2118
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:38,634
That white right there.

2119
01:18:38,785 --> 01:18:39,594
That's a safe spot.

2120
01:18:39,655 --> 01:18:40,285
Use the landmark.

2121
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:41,065
You come just medial.

2122
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:41,754
Just lateral.

2123
01:18:41,754 --> 01:18:42,714
See if it gives it to you.

2124
01:18:43,105 --> 01:18:43,375
leah: Okay.

2125
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:44,665
Maybe like.

2126
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:46,945
In here.

2127
01:18:47,035 --> 01:18:47,215
brian: Sure.

2128
01:18:47,425 --> 01:18:47,875
Try it up.

2129
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:50,935
If it gets it to you, it feels Looks pretty empty.

2130
01:18:51,055 --> 01:18:51,445
It does it.

2131
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:52,405
You push in and it goes in.

2132
01:18:53,935 --> 01:18:53,995
Yeah.

2133
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:54,655
That's a freebie.

2134
01:18:54,775 --> 01:18:56,005
You're gonna get all the way through on that.

2135
01:18:56,155 --> 01:18:56,515
I bet you

2136
01:18:57,415 --> 01:18:59,095
leah: just trying to make sure feels okay and make

2137
01:18:59,095 --> 01:19:00,055
brian: sure we don't see any white.

2138
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:02,750
You wanna look in that hole with, there you go.

2139
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:03,745
Good job.

2140
01:19:04,345 --> 01:19:04,675
Yep.

2141
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:07,285
Now it feels like nothing.

2142
01:19:07,285 --> 01:19:07,855
Burger, right?

2143
01:19:07,855 --> 01:19:08,185
It does.

2144
01:19:08,185 --> 01:19:09,835
Feels like absolutely nothing because you're past the dock.

2145
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:14,965
All right, push in, engage, push in, engage.

2146
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:17,155
That's it.

2147
01:19:17,155 --> 01:19:17,215
Now,

2148
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:26,095
push in hard, not engage.

2149
01:19:27,025 --> 01:19:27,320
That's it.

2150
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,880
leah: Okay.

2151
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,360
So we're technically through.

2152
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:29,560
If you know

2153
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,595
brian: a safe spot, just go for it.

2154
01:19:30,595 --> 01:19:31,225
That's speed.

2155
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,280
Make sure you keep her.

2156
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:32,360
Yeah.

2157
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,000
But you know the anatomy move faster.

2158
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:34,400
Focus.

2159
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:34,675
Okay.

2160
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:35,240
Okay.

2161
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,095
Now you're red ductus.

2162
01:19:38,185 --> 01:19:38,425
Yeah.

2163
01:19:38,935 --> 01:19:39,265
Or something.

2164
01:19:39,265 --> 01:19:39,775
Theoretically

2165
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,555
leah: anterior to me.

2166
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:40,975
Okay.

2167
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,175
A safe spot here.

2168
01:19:42,175 --> 01:19:42,865
I'm gonna do one more.

2169
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:43,195
Good.

2170
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:43,705
Spread.

2171
01:19:43,915 --> 01:19:44,665
Engage.

2172
01:19:45,595 --> 01:19:46,525
We don't think we're too low.

2173
01:19:47,545 --> 01:19:47,905
We don't know.

2174
01:19:47,995 --> 01:19:48,445
Okay.

2175
01:19:48,445 --> 01:19:48,640
It's safe here.

2176
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:49,345
Okay.

2177
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:50,575
All right.

2178
01:19:51,644 --> 01:19:53,144
brian: You don't know where base, I don't know,

2179
01:19:54,005 --> 01:19:54,865
leah: but I feel like I can come here.

2180
01:19:54,905 --> 01:19:55,025
I

2181
01:19:55,055 --> 01:19:55,430
brian: that too.

2182
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,150
Good.

2183
01:19:56,599 --> 01:19:57,590
That's exactly where I would've gone.

2184
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,240
Pushing a lot harder.

2185
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,349
There you go.

2186
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,110
Because you know what the anatomy is, right?

2187
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:03,410
Yeah.

2188
01:20:03,559 --> 01:20:06,980
It's no need to be tentative there typically.

2189
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,030
Good.

2190
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:09,080
I love the bend on that.

2191
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:09,950
Nice job.

2192
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,780
Really, really good.

2193
01:20:13,085 --> 01:20:18,440
So she's bringing it up, she's doing that to stay close to dock again is one of the 10,000 things.

2194
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:18,590
Right.

2195
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:19,880
She's demonstrated multiple

2196
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,599
leah: really fast.

2197
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:21,530
Okay.

2198
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:24,500
And if you're able to swing around and pop on this side, we'll see it on through.

2199
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:27,200
Yeah.

2200
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:28,490
Nice.

2201
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,420
Thanks, Degan.

2202
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:29,421
Okay.

2203
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,080
That was great.

2204
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:30,710
Now you know our base.

2205
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,235
I can take that.

2206
01:20:32,615 --> 01:20:32,835
Yep.

2207
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:33,155
You can

2208
01:20:33,155 --> 01:20:34,035
brian: see in there there's base.

2209
01:20:34,035 --> 01:20:34,355
Mm-hmm.

2210
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:34,915
Okay.

2211
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:36,590
Now we're, again, now we're covered with gas.

2212
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:36,890
Right?

2213
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:37,220
Okay.

2214
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,420
We're talking about speed before.

2215
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:39,019
All

2216
01:20:39,019 --> 01:20:42,500
leah: right, well, I'm gonna, I, I was gonna get my hook and take some of this down.

2217
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:42,590
Sure.

2218
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:42,800
Go for it.

2219
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:43,460
Cool.

2220
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,190
brian: Could be a, a artery coming through there.

2221
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:46,490
Remember?

2222
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:47,480
leah: Could be

2223
01:20:51,349 --> 01:20:52,130
all Perfect.

2224
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:52,550
Thank you.

2225
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,670
brian: Yeah, that's not an artery, right?

2226
01:20:59,120 --> 01:20:59,645
Just move like an.

2227
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,180
leah: Nice and thin.

2228
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:03,500
Okay.

2229
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:03,700
brian: Yeah.

2230
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:03,980
Do it.

2231
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:07,165
It's not our, don't pull so hard though, because there's true

2232
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,220
fat, fat vessels.

2233
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:17,980
leah: Okay.

2234
01:21:19,855 --> 01:21:21,325
I'm not making moves by doing this.

2235
01:21:21,325 --> 01:21:22,105
Let's think.

2236
01:21:23,215 --> 01:21:24,505
brian: You should be thinking, where would I go next?

2237
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:24,655
Always.

2238
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:26,890
Oh, not you, her.

2239
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:27,970
leah: I was like, I am.

2240
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:29,570
brian: I know you are.

2241
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,730
Okay, because you have to go next.

2242
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:33,195
No, I'm thinking

2243
01:21:33,885 --> 01:21:41,115
like that was what I was thinking earlier is putting her stuff in there because that was
clear and almost like you could see if you could get a lip in there that off big sweep,

2244
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:42,855
brian: aggressive sweep all the way up and down.

2245
01:21:42,855 --> 01:21:43,305
Even rips.

2246
01:21:43,305 --> 01:21:43,725
It's okay.

2247
01:21:44,235 --> 01:21:44,715
Big sweep.

2248
01:21:46,065 --> 01:21:48,315
'cause that's gonna be where we clip, so we need length there.

2249
01:21:48,345 --> 01:21:48,855
Okay.

2250
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:48,856
Right.

2251
01:21:48,861 --> 01:21:51,105
leah: That, that's actually very helpful to think about the big sweep.

2252
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:51,285
Yeah.

2253
01:21:51,285 --> 01:21:52,335
Even more sweep up even more.

2254
01:21:52,335 --> 01:21:52,425
It's

2255
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:53,475
brian: fat all the way up.

2256
01:21:55,335 --> 01:21:56,565
Can you dissect it up more?

2257
01:21:56,565 --> 01:21:57,730
You know, if not, we can't.

2258
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,520
Okay, great.

2259
01:21:59,700 --> 01:21:59,920
How?

2260
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,680
Get to the, here

2261
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:02,895
brian: we go.

2262
01:22:07,785 --> 01:22:08,535
Big sweep here too.

2263
01:22:09,015 --> 01:22:09,975
Strip that off, that duct.

2264
01:22:10,935 --> 01:22:11,475
That's it.

2265
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:12,285
That's the move.

2266
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:16,905
And then don't pull so hard when you're doing it because you, sorry,

2267
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:21,555
that was my thought was continue cleaning some of that off.

2268
01:22:21,555 --> 01:22:23,550
Working through what she's working through right now.

2269
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:24,310
Okay,

2270
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,715
brian: now you, so it's a test, right?

2271
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,630
I just broke answers that are correct.

2272
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:31,275
But I, you should always be thinking, what would I do next?

2273
01:22:31,275 --> 01:22:34,270
And when she does that next and it works, you're like, okay.

2274
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:35,190
And

2275
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:35,390
brian: if

2276
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:36,645
what you

2277
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,885
brian: want to do next, she never does.

2278
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:41,085
You should wonder why

2279
01:22:43,155 --> 01:22:43,875
big sweeps there.

2280
01:22:44,385 --> 01:22:45,945
So you see edge of duct right now?

2281
01:22:45,945 --> 01:22:47,055
I do saw, right?

2282
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:47,385
Yeah.

2283
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:47,925
You're brief.

2284
01:22:47,925 --> 01:22:48,615
That I'm staying away for.

2285
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:50,745
So you're almost in the wrong place to do your dissection.

2286
01:22:50,745 --> 01:22:51,615
Ah, okay.

2287
01:22:51,615 --> 01:22:51,790
You know what I mean?

2288
01:22:51,795 --> 01:22:54,975
Because you're gonna, if you cut this, you have less tissue there to do your sweet width.

2289
01:22:55,215 --> 01:22:55,575
leah: Oh.

2290
01:22:55,575 --> 01:22:56,505
So I should not plan.

2291
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:56,910
So just come out.

2292
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:57,070
Okay.

2293
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:57,230
You

2294
01:22:57,235 --> 01:22:59,325
brian: go into the right plane now you know where it's go right next to it.

2295
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:00,525
Get a lot of tissue there.

2296
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:01,875
Still not getting enough.

2297
01:23:02,304 --> 01:23:02,665
That's better.

2298
01:23:02,665 --> 01:23:03,235
That's okay.

2299
01:23:03,235 --> 01:23:06,835
It is what it's, and sweep up it out aggressively very aggressively.

2300
01:23:07,344 --> 01:23:08,184
Even more aggressive.

2301
01:23:08,724 --> 01:23:09,894
Rip it go, don't you?

2302
01:23:09,894 --> 01:23:10,255
I'm ripping.

2303
01:23:10,255 --> 01:23:10,644
I'm ripping.

2304
01:23:10,705 --> 01:23:11,005
leah: Okay.

2305
01:23:11,424 --> 01:23:11,575
Okay.

2306
01:23:12,205 --> 01:23:12,355
Yeah.

2307
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,150
And then clear off.

2308
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:15,476
leah: See, I'm

2309
01:23:17,905 --> 01:23:18,264
missed it.

2310
01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:19,195
I know.

2311
01:23:19,195 --> 01:23:19,884
I'm trying to get in there.

2312
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:21,910
Yeah.

2313
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,070
That was a good move.

2314
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:30,865
Noting I see my plane there.

2315
01:23:30,894 --> 01:23:31,195
Okay.

2316
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:36,115
Yeah.

2317
01:23:36,115 --> 01:23:37,014
Too much digging.

2318
01:23:39,565 --> 01:23:41,170
Oh, I see it right there.

2319
01:23:42,325 --> 01:23:42,505
Right there.

2320
01:23:42,505 --> 01:23:42,804
Hanging out.

2321
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:43,105
Yeah.

2322
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:43,285
Totally.

2323
01:23:45,085 --> 01:23:45,384
Okay,

2324
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,170
brian: so there's, keep going.

2325
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:53,130
I'm just gonna talk.

2326
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:53,610
Okay.

2327
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,434
So, uh, there's some risk in this.

2328
01:23:56,035 --> 01:23:56,215
Yep.

2329
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:59,730
Because we're going in, we're picking things out and we can't really see on this side.

2330
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:05,665
On the medial side, you can see really well and I, these moves pick me easier here.

2331
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,075
I do them, but they're a little riskier.

2332
01:24:08,155 --> 01:24:08,304
Right.

2333
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:10,674
I really like keep doing what you're doing, actually.

2334
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:11,125
Stay there.

2335
01:24:11,184 --> 01:24:11,365
Okay.

2336
01:24:11,365 --> 01:24:14,424
I really like scoring on this side though, because I do too.

2337
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:15,174
It releases it.

2338
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:17,724
I can pull it out farther and I, I'm coming through fat.

2339
01:24:17,724 --> 01:24:18,474
I can do nothing.

2340
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:23,760
There's no perine blocking, you know, so I, you know,

2341
01:24:26,335 --> 01:24:27,415
it has to be cut regardless.

2342
01:24:27,415 --> 01:24:27,565
So

2343
01:24:29,635 --> 01:24:30,595
you left hand in your own way

2344
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:31,330
leah: a little bit.

2345
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:33,835
So I was thinking about it, but it's currently fine.

2346
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:34,615
Get one or you get one more

2347
01:24:35,515 --> 01:24:35,755
brian: give up.

2348
01:24:37,585 --> 01:24:38,410
That's really nice though, right?

2349
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,925
We're starting to see base over there now.

2350
01:24:40,345 --> 01:24:40,615
Okay.

2351
01:24:40,735 --> 01:24:41,005
I see

2352
01:24:41,005 --> 01:24:42,805
leah: my duct coming in nice and clean.

2353
01:24:42,805 --> 01:24:44,005
I think I can still clean the duct.

2354
01:24:44,005 --> 01:24:44,425
brian: Really doing well here.

2355
01:24:45,535 --> 01:24:47,665
leah: I think I can still clean behind my duct.

2356
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,970
brian: Yeah, you can't, but what?

2357
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:50,810
It's up to you.

2358
01:24:50,845 --> 01:24:52,410
But remember how we got started at this?

2359
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:52,690
Mm-hmm.

2360
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:53,665
We were, we pulled this down.

2361
01:24:53,665 --> 01:24:54,415
You're like, where do we go?

2362
01:24:54,685 --> 01:24:54,955
Right.

2363
01:24:55,015 --> 01:24:55,675
We knew one thing.

2364
01:24:55,675 --> 01:24:58,075
What did we know artery was.

2365
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:58,290
Mm-hmm.

2366
01:24:58,675 --> 01:25:00,175
We use that as our starting point.

2367
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:00,530
leah: Okay.

2368
01:25:00,955 --> 01:25:01,135
brian: Okay.

2369
01:25:01,135 --> 01:25:02,425
You still know where artery is?

2370
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:02,530
Mm-hmm.

2371
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:05,695
And you can use the same principle now to take your Maryland on the other side of it.

2372
01:25:06,175 --> 01:25:06,985
You know exact words.

2373
01:25:06,985 --> 01:25:07,765
You can feel it.

2374
01:25:07,765 --> 01:25:08,785
It's very solid.

2375
01:25:09,325 --> 01:25:11,785
You can feel your way just lateral to that.

2376
01:25:11,845 --> 01:25:12,175
Okay.

2377
01:25:13,015 --> 01:25:15,235
With, I mean, appropriate caution, right.

2378
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:16,645
Because there could be things coming across.

2379
01:25:16,645 --> 01:25:16,735
Right.

2380
01:25:17,095 --> 01:25:17,335
Okay.

2381
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:19,615
But you know, there's something there that you can skeletonize.

2382
01:25:21,535 --> 01:25:22,435
leah: We come back a sec. Dig again?

2383
01:25:22,525 --> 01:25:22,675
Yep.

2384
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:23,875
You're good.

2385
01:25:25,015 --> 01:25:25,525
There she is.

2386
01:25:25,705 --> 01:25:25,975
Okay.

2387
01:25:26,275 --> 01:25:26,635
Thank you.

2388
01:25:27,325 --> 01:25:28,465
And now we come back in.

2389
01:25:28,465 --> 01:25:28,855
Sweet.

2390
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:28,980
Mm-hmm.

2391
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:29,380
Okay.

2392
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,620
Your art arties right

2393
01:25:33,775 --> 01:25:34,165
brian: here.

2394
01:25:34,165 --> 01:25:34,585
Sure.

2395
01:25:34,585 --> 01:25:35,425
So you feel your way.

2396
01:25:35,725 --> 01:25:38,245
I actually start on it actually, and I, and then roll off of it.

2397
01:25:38,575 --> 01:25:39,265
Yeah, that's what I do.

2398
01:25:42,014 --> 01:25:42,304
Okay,

2399
01:25:44,335 --> 01:25:45,625
because you'll be fast.

2400
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:52,910
Turn

2401
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,080
leah: to gauge.

2402
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:55,940
That feels like absolutely nothing.

2403
01:25:56,059 --> 01:25:58,519
brian: Your technique's off you beating on for technique.

2404
01:25:58,610 --> 01:25:59,000
Yes.

2405
01:25:59,059 --> 01:25:59,690
So do it again.

2406
01:25:59,750 --> 01:25:59,780
Okay.

2407
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:00,950
I want you to watch this time.

2408
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:01,400
What happened?

2409
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:02,090
You're upper time.

2410
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:02,630
Do it again.

2411
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:02,840
Shoot.

2412
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,760
Don't change the data.

2413
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,740
You changed something.

2414
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,099
Did I?

2415
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:08,425
You changed the thing you needed to change.

2416
01:26:08,425 --> 01:26:09,380
You rotated it down.

2417
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:11,120
Maybe I just thought about it more.

2418
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,120
When you rotate it up, you're just pushing down it and this one doesn't engage.

2419
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,230
Okay.

2420
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:17,030
You're not dissecting, so you rotated down there.

2421
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:17,660
Both engaged.

2422
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,130
You press them both in, there's friction.

2423
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:19,519
Got it.

2424
01:26:19,519 --> 01:26:20,420
And bam, you're ready?

2425
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:20,599
Yeah.

2426
01:26:20,599 --> 01:26:20,780
Yeah.

2427
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,019
Yeah.

2428
01:26:21,395 --> 01:26:24,365
So your angle is when you see it fly like that, it's okay.

2429
01:26:24,365 --> 01:26:25,025
Just adjust.

2430
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:25,355
Okay.

2431
01:26:25,775 --> 01:26:27,305
But you did it three times without adjusting.

2432
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:29,375
leah: Leah, come on.

2433
01:26:29,945 --> 01:26:30,215
brian: It's okay.

2434
01:26:30,455 --> 01:26:32,855
But then when I asked you, you subconsciously adjusted.

2435
01:26:34,295 --> 01:26:35,375
It's ruined my teaching point.

2436
01:26:37,505 --> 01:26:39,305
leah: Everyone still saw the flailing, so,

2437
01:26:39,665 --> 01:26:39,880
brian: so I don't know.

2438
01:26:40,145 --> 01:26:40,625
It's bleeding.

2439
01:26:41,495 --> 01:26:45,155
Maybe fat, maybe known through free for you.

2440
01:26:45,155 --> 01:26:45,455
Right.

2441
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:47,045
So, but there could be something.

2442
01:26:47,045 --> 01:26:47,165
Yeah,

2443
01:26:50,465 --> 01:26:51,455
see where you're on the other side.

2444
01:26:51,455 --> 01:26:54,185
Just because I'm, see if you can switch over.

2445
01:26:54,185 --> 01:26:54,695
There you go.

2446
01:26:55,265 --> 01:26:55,895
No left hand.

2447
01:26:56,345 --> 01:26:57,395
Maybe my ankles off yourself.

2448
01:26:58,740 --> 01:26:59,975
leah: No, I can't.

2449
01:27:00,185 --> 01:27:01,535
I think maybe eye angles off of that.

2450
01:27:01,535 --> 01:27:01,985
I go little harder.

2451
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:02,400
brian: I dunno.

2452
01:27:02,405 --> 01:27:02,975
I think you're good.

2453
01:27:03,185 --> 01:27:03,635
leah: You think so?

2454
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:06,605
brian: Yeah, sure isn't nice.

2455
01:27:07,265 --> 01:27:09,365
Well look at base on a second.

2456
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:10,115
This is interesting.

2457
01:27:11,165 --> 01:27:17,945
So I don't, it almost looks like it's there, but then it looks white here and we dissect it over there.

2458
01:27:17,945 --> 01:27:19,805
So I don't know what's, I actually don't know.

2459
01:27:21,545 --> 01:27:22,895
That sure looks like base though.

2460
01:27:25,265 --> 01:27:27,035
leah: But this also looks like gallbladder.

2461
01:27:27,095 --> 01:27:28,025
brian: It sure does.

2462
01:27:29,105 --> 01:27:32,680
That's a very odd, so that just means slow down so we don't understand anatomy, right?

2463
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:33,000
Yeah.

2464
01:27:33,515 --> 01:27:34,415
So anyway, you're down here.

2465
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:35,615
You could be lower than we think.

2466
01:27:35,615 --> 01:27:36,365
Yeah, I agree.

2467
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:37,055
Right.

2468
01:27:37,325 --> 01:27:40,145
That being said, I think you're okay to go through there and get it out.

2469
01:27:40,925 --> 01:27:41,705
Get up the other side.

2470
01:27:42,245 --> 01:27:42,575
Okay.

2471
01:27:42,875 --> 01:27:45,680
Maybe I'll come up higher or you can start higher, slightly higher, more, you know, whatever.

2472
01:27:46,415 --> 01:27:47,195
Just don't get a gall.

2473
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:49,000
That's.

2474
01:27:52,219 --> 01:27:54,259
That's a handrail that, can you just say it again?

2475
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:54,920
Your time, dammit.

2476
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:55,460
Just flopped.

2477
01:27:55,849 --> 01:27:56,389
I dunno if you noticed.

2478
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:56,509
I did

2479
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,380
see how much more solid that is.

2480
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:00,650
leah: Yeah.

2481
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:03,950
brian: You were talking about speed wasted.

2482
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:04,820
Moves are slow.

2483
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:08,809
When I.

2484
01:28:12,095 --> 01:28:13,595
leah: One more and then I'll take a peek

2485
01:28:17,735 --> 01:28:18,005
push.

2486
01:28:20,555 --> 01:28:21,455
Alright, one more.

2487
01:28:23,135 --> 01:28:23,405
Nice.

2488
01:28:23,405 --> 01:28:23,645
Thanks.

2489
01:28:23,645 --> 01:28:24,005
Degan.

2490
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:24,215
Yep.

2491
01:28:30,575 --> 01:28:30,785
leah: Good.

2492
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:31,595
I like the slightly box.

2493
01:28:32,135 --> 01:28:32,645
That was smart.

2494
01:28:33,095 --> 01:28:34,295
brian: Up that way because then you can see it.

2495
01:28:34,295 --> 01:28:35,075
I think so too.

2496
01:28:35,075 --> 01:28:35,345
Yeah.

2497
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:36,905
Pass down

2498
01:28:36,905 --> 01:28:37,055
there.

2499
01:28:40,355 --> 01:28:41,015
Now I would turn

2500
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:41,585
brian: my tips up.

2501
01:28:42,095 --> 01:28:42,365
Okay.

2502
01:28:42,455 --> 01:28:42,875
A little.

2503
01:28:43,145 --> 01:28:43,870
No, no, go in.

2504
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:45,485
It's dynamic.

2505
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:51,455
You go in, you turn your tips up because this surface is actually like at that angle, if your angle here, you sky.

2506
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:52,115
Oh, there they are.

2507
01:28:52,325 --> 01:28:52,625
leah: See 'em.

2508
01:28:54,185 --> 01:28:54,665
brian: That's come through.

2509
01:28:58,025 --> 01:28:58,295
leah: Okay.

2510
01:29:03,605 --> 01:29:03,845
It's not

2511
01:29:03,845 --> 01:29:04,445
brian: working for you though.

2512
01:29:05,135 --> 01:29:05,915
Um, aggressive.

2513
01:29:06,695 --> 01:29:08,015
leah: I actually feel like I'm making a move there.

2514
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:12,785
It's just doing a thousand little spreads, but I could probably be more aggressive,

2515
01:29:13,175 --> 01:29:14,225
brian: just not seeing you when I should.

2516
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:15,700
If it's fat, you know?

2517
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,260
It should be easy.

2518
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:19,660
It's good.

2519
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,105
There you go.

2520
01:29:20,105 --> 01:29:20,435
There you go.

2521
01:29:20,765 --> 01:29:21,425
Finally found it.

2522
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,035
Saw your time.

2523
01:29:24,515 --> 01:29:24,725
I did.

2524
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:24,935
They're,

2525
01:29:25,415 --> 01:29:25,655
leah: yeah.

2526
01:29:27,785 --> 01:29:28,025
brian: Okay.

2527
01:29:28,025 --> 01:29:29,420
Big spread the fat, big spread.

2528
01:29:31,655 --> 01:29:31,835
Okay.

2529
01:29:33,065 --> 01:29:33,395
leah: All right.

2530
01:29:34,505 --> 01:29:37,115
Behind artery, opening up our plane.

2531
01:29:37,265 --> 01:29:38,165
brian: Critical view here, huh?

2532
01:29:40,505 --> 01:29:40,775
leah: Great.

2533
01:29:40,835 --> 01:29:41,075
All right.

2534
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:42,365
Nice big spread behind artery.

2535
01:29:42,695 --> 01:29:44,915
We've got the U behind the duct.

2536
01:29:45,065 --> 01:29:48,335
We can get some of the schmutz between ducted and artery if we need to.

2537
01:29:49,085 --> 01:29:51,545
The question is, do we think we need to, and then we gotta get our cystic plate

2538
01:29:53,675 --> 01:29:57,485
spread again here, because that's where we're gonna staple.

2539
01:29:57,815 --> 01:29:58,055
Yep.

2540
01:29:58,085 --> 01:29:58,505
Nice.

2541
01:29:58,535 --> 01:29:58,805
Okay.

2542
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:02,560
Okay.

2543
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:04,540
I think we have a good window here.

2544
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,486
How do you feel about getting our, that what you wanna do?

2545
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,350
It's gonna come around the back of gallbladder to get our cystic plate.

2546
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:11,860
brian: Cool.

2547
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:13,930
Yeah, there's lots of things you could do here.

2548
01:30:14,019 --> 01:30:14,620
Well what would you do?

2549
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,120
Uh, well would I do?

2550
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:19,660
Well you gotta clear off the base, right?

2551
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:19,765
Yeah.

2552
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,519
So, and you've gotta skeletonize the ducks.

2553
01:30:21,519 --> 01:30:23,590
Those are two things you have to do, right?

2554
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:26,325
So you've got a lot of fat there and you're not skeletonized, so,

2555
01:30:26,435 --> 01:30:26,725
leah: okay.

2556
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:31,720
brian: You know how you get to the fat, it's probably easier on the medial side than the lateral 'cause you can see it.

2557
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,170
leah: Yeah.

2558
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,850
brian: I give you very high level goals.

2559
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:39,310
If you want more detail, I'm happy to go to, I wanted to help

2560
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:42,519
some stress.

2561
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:45,850
leah: That's a bad grab.

2562
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:54,480
Lip there.

2563
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:56,310
Cake.

2564
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,700
Maybe I'll hook across that.

2565
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:03,240
Okay.

2566
01:31:08,985 --> 01:31:09,275
Yeah.

2567
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:11,440
leah: It's gonna bleed

2568
01:31:11,919 --> 01:31:12,700
brian: with that dumb grab.

2569
01:31:13,245 --> 01:31:14,440
Grab camera please.

2570
01:31:15,549 --> 01:31:16,210
Coming with the camera.

2571
01:31:16,629 --> 01:31:17,740
Anytime she's dissecting.

2572
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:18,370
You wanna be closed?

2573
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:19,092
I'm gonna stop that.

2574
01:31:19,092 --> 01:31:21,250
She's coming in and outta the body or pauses to get a look around.

2575
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:21,849
Come back.

2576
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:24,940
leah: Okay.

2577
01:31:25,719 --> 01:31:27,040
I've gotta clean off my artery.

2578
01:31:39,945 --> 01:31:41,719
Gotta skeletonize my artery.

2579
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,880
Do you usually just, yeah, I'll just pull,

2580
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,019
get in there.

2581
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:54,860
Difficult.

2582
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:55,670
Not gonna do that.

2583
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,019
Hmm.

2584
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:07,550
brian: So that's your nodal

2585
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:08,000
leah: bleeding.

2586
01:32:08,179 --> 01:32:08,330
brian: Okay.

2587
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:09,290
So that's your node.

2588
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:09,590
Yep.

2589
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:14,630
So I would control, its va, its vascular, pedicle

2590
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:15,740
actually.

2591
01:32:15,889 --> 01:32:16,130
Okay.

2592
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:17,240
brian: And take it out.

2593
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:21,620
It's usually the easy, it's usually faster to do that than let it bleed.

2594
01:32:21,889 --> 01:32:22,309
Have bleeding.

2595
01:32:22,519 --> 01:32:22,760
Okay.

2596
01:32:23,269 --> 01:32:25,340
So there's the upper pole and there's the lower.

2597
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:28,094
Usually I go upper, but here you almost have, I have lower, dissect it out.

2598
01:32:28,165 --> 01:32:28,455
Yeah.

2599
01:32:28,474 --> 01:32:30,200
So I would dissect that out further.

2600
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:30,889
Get behind it.

2601
01:32:30,889 --> 01:32:34,894
I go into, you know, and I'm coming this angle.

2602
01:32:35,844 --> 01:32:36,135
Sure.

2603
01:32:37,235 --> 01:32:39,655
brian: And just don't pull too hard because you want to coagulate this.

2604
01:32:41,724 --> 01:32:42,255
It's too hard.

2605
01:32:42,559 --> 01:32:42,800
That was

2606
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:43,340
leah: still too hard.

2607
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,179
Yeah, because it,

2608
01:32:44,635 --> 01:32:47,295
brian: it should take like half a second to go through there.

2609
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:47,840
There you go.

2610
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:48,740
That's there.

2611
01:32:51,845 --> 01:32:52,065
Yep.

2612
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:52,550
Perfect.

2613
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:54,080
And it stay on artery.

2614
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:58,265
'cause you know, everything, this side of the artery is either nothing or a pedicle to the head.

2615
01:32:58,270 --> 01:32:58,580
Right.

2616
01:32:58,585 --> 01:32:58,785
Okay.

2617
01:32:58,785 --> 01:32:59,065
Right.

2618
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:00,890
So push in with the heel mm-hmm.

2619
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,145
And show you when to go.

2620
01:33:02,245 --> 01:33:02,465
Yep.

2621
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:04,670
You know, a little bit of this.

2622
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,840
Turn it, get a pick.

2623
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,990
Make sure it's a pick on a big structure.

2624
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,270
Slide up and down aggressively.

2625
01:33:12,465 --> 01:33:13,425
Okay, good.

2626
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:14,835
Now don't pull too hard.

2627
01:33:16,065 --> 01:33:16,485
Perfect.

2628
01:33:16,965 --> 01:33:17,745
Okay, perfect.

2629
01:33:18,165 --> 01:33:18,465
Better?

2630
01:33:21,945 --> 01:33:22,425
Good.

2631
01:33:23,175 --> 01:33:24,195
Now you gotta be careful with this, right?

2632
01:33:24,195 --> 01:33:24,285
Yep.

2633
01:33:24,285 --> 01:33:25,995
There could be something in there that's mine.

2634
01:33:25,995 --> 01:33:30,920
So you're force these things, but once you get it, then you can slide up another breath, things it should be done.

2635
01:33:31,365 --> 01:33:31,720
Feels like nothing.

2636
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:32,162
Doesn't feel like nothing.

2637
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:33,075
leah: Feels like nothing.

2638
01:33:33,615 --> 01:33:34,005
brian: Little thick.

2639
01:33:35,355 --> 01:33:35,385
Okay.

2640
01:33:35,385 --> 01:33:36,120
Perfectly done.

2641
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,400
Okay.

2642
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:37,935
leah: Perfectly done.

2643
01:33:37,935 --> 01:33:38,595
I still see my art.

2644
01:33:38,595 --> 01:33:39,080
I already got that.

2645
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:40,680
Okay.

2646
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:41,120
brian: Right.

2647
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,960
Kind of got it.

2648
01:33:42,110 --> 01:33:42,400
Yeah.

2649
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:42,880
Run.

2650
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,600
You might just consider grabbing it, I dunno.

2651
01:33:47,985 --> 01:33:48,435
leah: The node.

2652
01:33:49,065 --> 01:33:49,185
brian: Yeah.

2653
01:33:49,185 --> 01:33:50,445
You can also try and go above it.

2654
01:33:52,525 --> 01:33:55,254
It should be, I don't know where it's vascularized.

2655
01:33:55,705 --> 01:33:57,355
Usually it's sized interior.

2656
01:33:57,504 --> 01:33:57,835
Right.

2657
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:02,004
leah: Just trying to clean up my artery.

2658
01:34:02,155 --> 01:34:02,724
Sure you have to.

2659
01:34:02,724 --> 01:34:02,905
Yeah.

2660
01:34:06,025 --> 01:34:06,415
Which I could do.

2661
01:34:06,894 --> 01:34:07,674
Still bleeding.

2662
01:34:07,735 --> 01:34:10,105
Made it bleed again, didn't I?

2663
01:34:11,905 --> 01:34:12,144
Okay,

2664
01:34:13,224 --> 01:34:13,375
brian: good.

2665
01:34:13,585 --> 01:34:14,030
Pick it back.

2666
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:15,085
It holding you open.

2667
01:34:15,085 --> 01:34:15,565
It's free.

2668
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:18,219
Yeah, that's a good one.

2669
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,839
You wanna the fat?

2670
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:25,360
Mm-hmm.

2671
01:34:25,469 --> 01:34:25,920
Cook in.

2672
01:34:27,519 --> 01:34:27,809
leah: Okay.

2673
01:34:29,509 --> 01:34:29,929
brian: Now what

2674
01:34:32,815 --> 01:34:35,785
leah: I am trying to skeletonize my artery right now is what I'm trying to do.

2675
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:39,684
That's my goal of my current steps.

2676
01:34:40,014 --> 01:34:40,554
Thanks Dagan.

2677
01:34:40,585 --> 01:34:40,674
Mm-hmm.

2678
01:34:43,195 --> 01:34:44,815
So I'm just gonna feel around behind it.

2679
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:45,235
Sorry.

2680
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:47,214
Okay.

2681
01:34:51,625 --> 01:34:54,565
I don't wanna dig into gallbladder, but I'm below artery.

2682
01:34:55,825 --> 01:34:56,094
brian: Lovely.

2683
01:34:56,184 --> 01:34:56,964
Pushing up artery.

2684
01:34:58,254 --> 01:34:58,585
That correct?

2685
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:00,625
leah: Right.

2686
01:35:01,134 --> 01:35:01,315
Perfect.

2687
01:35:05,424 --> 01:35:08,634
Like I could be making more progress if I were doing something slightly different

2688
01:35:08,634 --> 01:35:09,596
appropriately when you weren't.

2689
01:35:12,515 --> 01:35:13,295
I'm just pulling on it

2690
01:35:13,295 --> 01:35:14,765
leah: slightly on here.

2691
01:35:17,525 --> 01:35:18,485
Why'd you go so low?

2692
01:35:18,485 --> 01:35:19,595
Why it go there?

2693
01:35:20,135 --> 01:35:20,165
Oh,

2694
01:35:20,525 --> 01:35:20,825
brian: why'd you?

2695
01:35:20,885 --> 01:35:23,585
You went up and that side down here, but you don't know what's down there.

2696
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:23,860
True.

2697
01:35:24,035 --> 01:35:25,925
Okay, so it could be like hepatic arteries there.

2698
01:35:26,165 --> 01:35:26,435
Okay.

2699
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:27,905
Let it go where you can see the tips.

2700
01:35:27,905 --> 01:35:28,355
There you go.

2701
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:31,175
Now stay on that duck and spread wide

2702
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:34,100
wide.

2703
01:35:35,285 --> 01:35:35,705
That's it.

2704
01:35:36,095 --> 01:35:37,085
Now you got a good job, right?

2705
01:35:37,415 --> 01:35:37,625
Yeah.

2706
01:35:37,955 --> 01:35:38,915
This thing's kind in your way.

2707
01:35:38,915 --> 01:35:39,665
I would just grab it, right?

2708
01:35:39,665 --> 01:35:40,580
The node.

2709
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:41,140
Yeah.

2710
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:42,740
There you go.

2711
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,340
It up.

2712
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:44,220
Up.

2713
01:35:46,985 --> 01:35:48,590
You took the Pele, right?

2714
01:35:49,425 --> 01:35:50,085
Theoretically.

2715
01:35:50,085 --> 01:35:50,535
leah: Theoretically.

2716
01:35:51,765 --> 01:35:53,625
brian: Because you gotta skeletonize the artery.

2717
01:35:53,715 --> 01:35:54,645
No, here's this,

2718
01:35:54,735 --> 01:35:55,815
leah: there's just dropped off node.

2719
01:35:55,935 --> 01:35:56,235
Okay.

2720
01:36:00,315 --> 01:36:00,855
All right.

2721
01:36:02,025 --> 01:36:03,735
So I need to skeletonize my,

2722
01:36:05,055 --> 01:36:06,465
brian: we dunno where the gallbladder is.

2723
01:36:06,555 --> 01:36:07,005
I don't know.

2724
01:36:07,005 --> 01:36:08,270
Into gallbladder.

2725
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:09,795
Pretty that stuff.

2726
01:36:09,795 --> 01:36:09,975
Safe?

2727
01:36:10,185 --> 01:36:10,425
leah: Yeah, sure.

2728
01:36:11,325 --> 01:36:14,235
This is where we had made our previous, um, window.

2729
01:36:18,465 --> 01:36:21,705
The question is, do we have enough room to get our stapler around here?

2730
01:36:23,145 --> 01:36:23,266
I don't know.

2731
01:36:23,266 --> 01:36:23,535
I don't either.

2732
01:36:23,655 --> 01:36:24,945
I could clean this schmitz here.

2733
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,745
That's gauge.

2734
01:36:26,775 --> 01:36:28,065
I'm just sort of hugging, engaging.

2735
01:36:28,065 --> 01:36:28,905
Yeah, I did.

2736
01:36:30,855 --> 01:36:32,235
There you go.

2737
01:36:32,235 --> 01:36:32,565
Much better

2738
01:36:36,135 --> 01:36:36,675
relative.

2739
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:40,335
brian: Tilt it up other direction.

2740
01:36:40,335 --> 01:36:41,295
You til the wrong direction.

2741
01:36:41,745 --> 01:36:42,495
Your time tilted up.

2742
01:36:42,790 --> 01:36:43,290
Oh my time.

2743
01:36:43,785 --> 01:36:44,415
Not that much.

2744
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:46,545
Go into that same hole.

2745
01:36:47,965 --> 01:36:50,845
Spread progressively a little more, you know, make some more progress.

2746
01:36:50,845 --> 01:36:51,055
Here.

2747
01:36:52,255 --> 01:36:52,825
Go, go, go.

2748
01:36:56,515 --> 01:36:56,815
That's it.

2749
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:07,730
leah: Okay.

2750
01:37:08,095 --> 01:37:08,275
Right.

2751
01:37:10,255 --> 01:37:12,985
brian: I find it on this side easier to flip your finger out, actually.

2752
01:37:13,285 --> 01:37:13,315
Oh.

2753
01:37:13,315 --> 01:37:15,415
Because it curves around and get more distance on the fat.

2754
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:16,170
Okay.

2755
01:37:18,475 --> 01:37:20,395
I don't know why I'm making the fat bleed so much here.

2756
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:21,530
brian: I think that's totally safe.

2757
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,820
Gentle that she wasn't sure where it was gonna rip in the plane.

2758
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,220
So she was looking as she ripped and it didn't really what she wanted so she stopped.

2759
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:33,860
Yeah, it didn't,

2760
01:37:35,295 --> 01:37:38,475
leah: I would maybe take some of this with my Marilyn in and out and then take my hook.

2761
01:37:38,475 --> 01:37:38,745
But

2762
01:37:39,945 --> 01:37:40,725
brian: lot of approaches here.

2763
01:37:40,905 --> 01:37:41,265
leah: Yeah,

2764
01:37:42,105 --> 01:37:43,065
brian: lot of tactics.

2765
01:37:45,645 --> 01:37:46,305
Familiar with the camera

2766
01:37:54,195 --> 01:37:54,525
that myself.

2767
01:37:54,525 --> 01:37:55,395
There is a lot of shit going on.

2768
01:37:55,545 --> 01:37:56,205
Yeah, there is.

2769
01:37:56,745 --> 01:37:57,165
Feels too.

2770
01:37:58,035 --> 01:37:59,415
I agree with how strategy I like it.

2771
01:38:03,855 --> 01:38:05,370
Trying to really push onto it when you do it.

2772
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:06,530
That is

2773
01:38:11,295 --> 01:38:11,595
okay.

2774
01:38:11,715 --> 01:38:11,925
Don't

2775
01:38:11,925 --> 01:38:12,525
leah: love weird.

2776
01:38:13,275 --> 01:38:14,625
Oh then I made my artery bleed here

2777
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:18,075
brian: so my, yeah, well that was my node but it wasn't totally vascular.

2778
01:38:18,075 --> 01:38:18,225
I, sorry.

2779
01:38:18,675 --> 01:38:18,885
Oh well

2780
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:19,755
leah: that was my fault.

2781
01:38:19,755 --> 01:38:20,325
We're not vascular it.

2782
01:38:20,355 --> 01:38:20,385
Okay.

2783
01:38:21,525 --> 01:38:21,735
Sorry.

2784
01:38:22,905 --> 01:38:23,595
Do we want one?

2785
01:38:24,915 --> 01:38:25,790
brian: There's two poors

2786
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:32,115
yet we can do is try and skeletonize that artery

2787
01:38:34,695 --> 01:38:35,055
my fault.

2788
01:38:35,055 --> 01:38:35,475
I'm sorry.

2789
01:38:37,905 --> 01:38:39,615
I want it out of there 'cause it needs to get out there.

2790
01:38:39,615 --> 01:38:42,345
But I, we shouldn't have a couple more burns around it.

2791
01:38:49,740 --> 01:38:50,100
leah: Okay,

2792
01:38:58,080 --> 01:38:59,580
brian: so I want you to dissect the rest of the artery out.

2793
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:00,060
Okay.

2794
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:01,830
Um, on both sides.

2795
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:02,550
Use the Maryland, okay?

2796
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:06,690
I'm giving you more tactical stuff right now because I think we should get that artery out of our way.

2797
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:07,920
It's totally in the way.

2798
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:08,385
Yeah, I agree.

2799
01:39:08,385 --> 01:39:13,019
That's, I want you to, what you do is I want you to go in there and hold on up, down on that spread, spread, spread.

2800
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:16,080
Once you know how far it goes up, you're not at base.

2801
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:16,920
Then come from this side.

2802
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:17,370
Spread.

2803
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:17,760
Spread.

2804
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:19,920
Get it fully skeletonized clip, click cut.

2805
01:39:19,925 --> 01:39:20,185
Okay.

2806
01:39:20,185 --> 01:39:20,970
Okay, great.

2807
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:27,025
There.

2808
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:36,370
brian: There too.

2809
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:37,224
That's really easy.

2810
01:39:40,894 --> 01:39:41,785
Okay, keep going.

2811
01:39:46,724 --> 01:39:47,304
Really good.

2812
01:39:49,325 --> 01:39:51,304
So there's a little hanger up there or something?

2813
01:39:51,304 --> 01:39:51,785
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2814
01:39:51,835 --> 01:39:52,825
Maybe coming off.

2815
01:39:52,825 --> 01:39:53,184
Mm-hmm.

2816
01:39:53,695 --> 01:39:54,144
It's okay.

2817
01:39:54,245 --> 01:39:55,089
Go in where you were.

2818
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:55,599
That's good.

2819
01:39:55,599 --> 01:39:56,230
That was productive.

2820
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:57,429
Just on a whole, that thing.

2821
01:39:57,820 --> 01:39:58,030
Okay.

2822
01:39:58,809 --> 01:39:59,200
Want cut it?

2823
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:00,280
That's it.

2824
01:40:03,190 --> 01:40:03,580
Yeah,

2825
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,000
leah: exactly.

2826
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,750
Change my times.

2827
01:40:07,059 --> 01:40:07,360
That's it.

2828
01:40:07,509 --> 01:40:07,839
Perfect.

2829
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:13,035
That slight move was perfect because that is, I think you're on VLA actually.

2830
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:13,554
brian: You think so?

2831
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:14,075
That right?

2832
01:40:14,679 --> 01:40:16,929
I dunno, because when you were lifting up, I only saw a VLA behind.

2833
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:17,410
Yeah.

2834
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:19,179
It's come from this side just down there.

2835
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:21,969
Clip it there, you know.

2836
01:40:23,589 --> 01:40:24,309
Clear that off.

2837
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:25,839
Good.

2838
01:40:25,839 --> 01:40:26,650
That was a nice move.

2839
01:40:29,514 --> 01:40:32,375
My grandparents, do you have 10 millimeter cup PLI out?

2840
01:40:32,804 --> 01:40:33,974
Yeah, you can open it for us, please.

2841
01:40:36,644 --> 01:40:36,934
Okay,

2842
01:40:36,969 --> 01:40:37,330
brian: that's great.

2843
01:40:37,929 --> 01:40:39,580
So we know that's artery, that's not emphatic.

2844
01:40:39,639 --> 01:40:40,179
That's not a duct.

2845
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:41,679
Right?

2846
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:42,129
It's too small.

2847
01:40:42,605 --> 01:40:44,525
leah: It's too small going directly into gallbladder.

2848
01:40:44,525 --> 01:40:44,974
brian: Yeah, it's fine.

2849
01:40:45,065 --> 01:40:46,355
So we're gonna take it Okay.

2850
01:40:46,355 --> 01:40:48,634
Little hour, because it's gonna hopefully help everything else.

2851
01:40:48,754 --> 01:40:48,815
Yeah.

2852
01:40:48,849 --> 01:40:49,775
And it's bleeding into the right.

2853
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:50,615
So we'll do

2854
01:40:51,155 --> 01:40:53,044
leah: clip here, clip here, clip there.

2855
01:40:53,044 --> 01:40:53,344
Cut.

2856
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:54,275
Okay.

2857
01:40:57,995 --> 01:40:58,714
Yeah, that'd be really nice.

2858
01:40:58,714 --> 01:40:59,495
Once that's out of the way.

2859
01:40:59,825 --> 01:41:00,004
brian: Yeah.

2860
01:41:00,004 --> 01:41:01,294
And then you're just start spreading through this.

2861
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:01,969
Okay.

2862
01:41:01,969 --> 01:41:03,754
Cutting and spreading and cutting and spreading.

2863
01:41:05,105 --> 01:41:05,134
leah: Okay.

2864
01:41:05,134 --> 01:41:05,405
Thank you.

2865
01:41:12,724 --> 01:41:13,415
Thanks Kat.

2866
01:41:20,545 --> 01:41:22,120
brian: How does she know what angle that was?

2867
01:41:23,755 --> 01:41:26,725
We're trying to think about being able to see like the tips of the other like

2868
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:27,895
brian: angle.

2869
01:41:28,045 --> 01:41:31,000
You turn the tips that way or do you turn that way?

2870
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:31,480
I want

2871
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:37,165
like kind of go in and then see like we could with right there Dr. George.

2872
01:41:37,165 --> 01:41:37,255
Sure.

2873
01:41:38,455 --> 01:41:41,815
Like thinking about the angle of like wanting to be around it but then seeing like,

2874
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:42,835
brian: Nope.

2875
01:41:43,195 --> 01:41:44,725
So the core principle is this.

2876
01:41:45,265 --> 01:41:47,065
You have a duct or an artery or whatever.

2877
01:41:47,545 --> 01:41:49,285
You don't wanna go obliquely across perpen.

2878
01:41:49,405 --> 01:41:49,915
That's what I meant.

2879
01:41:49,975 --> 01:41:50,245
Yeah.

2880
01:41:50,335 --> 01:41:54,001
Like looking it up, perpendicular there, but then like making sure the tips there is that

2881
01:41:54,385 --> 01:41:55,555
brian: either way you see the tips.

2882
01:41:55,555 --> 01:41:56,695
Tips have nothing to do with what angle's.

2883
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,400
Okay.

2884
01:41:58,015 --> 01:42:01,555
The angle is entirely about what makes it per the axis of the structure.

2885
01:42:01,790 --> 01:42:02,080
Okay.

2886
01:42:02,455 --> 01:42:02,605
Okay.

2887
01:42:02,605 --> 01:42:07,240
So sometimes the structure's that way you're gonna have to have curling down like that.

2888
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:07,720
Okay.

2889
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,425
Structure like that you're gonna have have report fixed.

2890
01:42:12,145 --> 01:42:12,205
Okay.

2891
01:42:12,205 --> 01:42:13,555
You only degrees of freedom port.

2892
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,600
Mm-hmm Left hand and with the angle of your, that's it.

2893
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,040
Oh, okay.

2894
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:19,240
So you're using both of those.

2895
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,760
You can change the angle this way and you can change the angle with your Oh, okay.

2896
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:23,120
Okay.

2897
01:42:23,215 --> 01:42:23,935
See how she's perfect.

2898
01:42:24,385 --> 01:42:26,455
Perpendicular these two were are not close enough together?

2899
01:42:26,755 --> 01:42:27,415
Yes, please.

2900
01:42:27,565 --> 01:42:27,925
Sorry.

2901
01:42:27,925 --> 01:42:28,255
Thank you.

2902
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:32,875
leah: I should have done them, the bottom two.

2903
01:42:32,875 --> 01:42:35,395
Closer together, but not perfect.

2904
01:42:35,395 --> 01:42:37,435
It's not perfect, which makes me sad.

2905
01:42:37,915 --> 01:42:38,575
Totally acceptable.

2906
01:42:42,905 --> 01:42:43,565
leah: I was watching.

2907
01:42:44,435 --> 01:42:44,915
Oh, I know.

2908
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:45,635
I saw, I was watching.

2909
01:42:45,635 --> 01:42:46,025
Me watching.

2910
01:42:50,075 --> 01:42:52,565
So now that we have that, then it'll be easier to clear off like this.

2911
01:42:56,345 --> 01:42:57,365
Ooh, I'm actually gonna just

2912
01:42:57,395 --> 01:42:58,295
leah: get my Beauvoir wa

2913
01:43:02,585 --> 01:43:02,795
okay

2914
01:43:04,445 --> 01:43:06,035
brian: to, are you guys okay if I take all El paa?

2915
01:43:06,515 --> 01:43:07,205
Yeah, a hundred percent.

2916
01:43:07,205 --> 01:43:10,025
In terms of like balancing service and education,

2917
01:43:11,465 --> 01:43:13,745
leah: I don't wanna go digging through this fact that I, it's, I agree.

2918
01:43:13,745 --> 01:43:14,075
I would've

2919
01:43:14,075 --> 01:43:18,845
brian: know exactly what you did every single part of Put it in, think it's thick, come out, try something else.

2920
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:22,385
leah: I just don't wanna go in gallbladder either, but I think that's just peritoneum.

2921
01:43:23,255 --> 01:43:27,755
brian: I think what I would do is, yeah, you can try that, but if
you're not finding any targets for hookups, switch instruments.

2922
01:43:27,815 --> 01:43:27,905
Mm-hmm.

2923
01:43:28,145 --> 01:43:28,175
Okay.

2924
01:43:28,175 --> 01:43:31,865
Just, I, I would've, this is the perfectly acceptable effect and you learn.

2925
01:43:31,865 --> 01:43:31,985
Mm-hmm.

2926
01:43:32,225 --> 01:43:32,675
It's not useful.

2927
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:33,700
leah: Okay.

2928
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:34,420
Perfect.

2929
01:43:34,895 --> 01:43:35,285
Thank you.

2930
01:43:35,615 --> 01:43:37,115
brian: Your left hand's pretty weak sauce too.

2931
01:43:37,175 --> 01:43:37,415
Still.

2932
01:43:37,895 --> 01:43:41,015
Well, yeah, because you're putting this on tension, but you're not putting any of this on tension.

2933
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:41,501
leah: Oh, okay.

2934
01:43:42,095 --> 01:43:42,425
Oh, see?

2935
01:43:42,545 --> 01:43:42,875
Yeah.

2936
01:43:43,175 --> 01:43:45,215
brian: Which is good if you're dissecting here, but it's not, not dissect.

2937
01:43:45,575 --> 01:43:45,755
That's.

2938
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:47,690
Right.

2939
01:43:47,990 --> 01:43:49,580
She's gonna roll it to bring it on over.

2940
01:43:50,210 --> 01:43:50,930
Open times.

2941
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,900
Grab right there.

2942
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:54,590
Okay.

2943
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:55,760
Oh, I see now.

2944
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:56,060
Yep.

2945
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:58,490
Now I see the roll.

2946
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:03,500
leah: If I can do it nice and wide, I know I'm not gonna get a good grip here I don't think.

2947
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:03,620
Fine.

2948
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,641
brian: Your left your right hand.

2949
01:44:06,165 --> 01:44:06,855
It's not helping.

2950
01:44:07,035 --> 01:44:07,394
It's not.

2951
01:44:07,394 --> 01:44:08,686
No, we have to have cat show you.

2952
01:44:08,691 --> 01:44:09,010
There we go.

2953
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:09,850
She actually mastered it.

2954
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:10,450
I think that's better.

2955
01:44:10,845 --> 01:44:12,090
You still don't think that's better's susceptible?

2956
01:44:12,095 --> 01:44:12,315
Okay.

2957
01:44:12,555 --> 01:44:14,235
It's not as good as Cat did it the other day.

2958
01:44:14,325 --> 01:44:14,655
I'm not

2959
01:44:14,655 --> 01:44:15,135
leah: surprised.

2960
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:17,175
brian: I know I'm, she did a really nice job.

2961
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:18,090
Okay,

2962
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,330
I have very good.

2963
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:21,730
brian: And now you can see why it's useful, right?

2964
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:22,250
Yeah.

2965
01:44:22,575 --> 01:44:24,015
I wanna say up on gallbladder.

2966
01:44:24,285 --> 01:44:24,945
Yeah, I think that's gall.

2967
01:44:25,155 --> 01:44:25,740
I think so too.

2968
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:27,255
Just the way it moves.

2969
01:44:27,255 --> 01:44:28,335
It looks like I wouldn't go there.

2970
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:29,745
Oh, I think that's gall there.

2971
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:30,290
Okay.

2972
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:32,745
This is not, I'm not sure yet.

2973
01:44:34,905 --> 01:44:35,085
Rip that.

2974
01:44:35,355 --> 01:44:35,565
Yeah.

2975
01:44:37,365 --> 01:44:37,695
brian: Okay.

2976
01:44:38,055 --> 01:44:45,885
So just the way it moved, when it pushed in there, it felt, and I wonder if
there's another, it looked like it kind of moved everything when you pushed.

2977
01:44:46,005 --> 01:44:46,725
Just try again.

2978
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:49,130
leah: I dunno.

2979
01:44:49,635 --> 01:44:49,876
I don't know.

2980
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:50,505
I think there's ball

2981
01:44:50,505 --> 01:44:50,775
brian: wire

2982
01:44:50,775 --> 01:44:51,045
leah: there.

2983
01:44:51,045 --> 01:44:52,965
You a posterior, I pull

2984
01:44:52,965 --> 01:44:53,090
brian: this here.

2985
01:44:53,144 --> 01:44:53,355
Okay.

2986
01:44:53,535 --> 01:44:54,675
That one feels freebie.

2987
01:44:54,945 --> 01:44:55,095
Mm-hmm.

2988
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:56,925
Just see what you got in there.

2989
01:45:01,515 --> 01:45:02,010
You feel like that?

2990
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:02,330
Yep.

2991
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,010
Okay.

2992
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,130
As long as it feels like that you're good.

2993
01:45:05,595 --> 01:45:07,035
leah: Just don't wanna hit a posterior artery.

2994
01:45:07,035 --> 01:45:07,125
Yeah.

2995
01:45:07,125 --> 01:45:08,745
What I would do is I often spread this way

2996
01:45:09,825 --> 01:45:13,485
brian: honestly, because I'm, I'm like making bands, but then I can cut later.

2997
01:45:13,605 --> 01:45:14,535
Oh, okay.

2998
01:45:14,565 --> 01:45:14,595
Okay.

2999
01:45:15,015 --> 01:45:15,585
leah: It's like this.

3000
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:17,205
brian: Yeah.

3001
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:17,570
Just feel your.

3002
01:45:17,985 --> 01:45:18,915
Dylan for gallbladder.

3003
01:45:19,035 --> 01:45:19,695
Yeah, I'm trying to

3004
01:45:19,695 --> 01:45:20,144
leah: push up.

3005
01:45:20,144 --> 01:45:22,455
I think that's gallbladder there, so I'm trying to push up against it.

3006
01:45:22,724 --> 01:45:23,205
That was a nice one.

3007
01:45:23,415 --> 01:45:26,235
Try to get posterior plane and I saw a white bear, so I did.

3008
01:45:26,325 --> 01:45:26,745
Oh yeah.

3009
01:45:26,924 --> 01:45:27,974
'
brian: cause you don't know what's gonna be there.

3010
01:45:28,065 --> 01:45:28,785
So then come back.

3011
01:45:28,995 --> 01:45:30,075
Oh, that was really nice, by the way.

3012
01:45:30,075 --> 01:45:31,275
Now you have a band for your hook later.

3013
01:45:31,995 --> 01:45:34,815
So go slightly off now and do the same exact route.

3014
01:45:34,844 --> 01:45:34,875
Okay?

3015
01:45:37,304 --> 01:45:37,755
Yes.

3016
01:45:39,224 --> 01:45:39,705
Perfect.

3017
01:45:43,394 --> 01:45:43,844
Perfect.

3018
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:43,905
Okay.

3019
01:45:48,995 --> 01:45:50,525
leah: Making the bleed Classic.

3020
01:45:53,285 --> 01:45:53,344
brian: Now.

3021
01:45:53,344 --> 01:45:54,275
You got some targets though.

3022
01:45:54,634 --> 01:45:54,934
leah: Okay.

3023
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,665
brian: I think there may be an artery back there.

3024
01:45:57,844 --> 01:45:58,504
Yeah, I agree.

3025
01:45:58,894 --> 01:46:01,264
Where it's common or hepatic, I guess.

3026
01:46:01,415 --> 01:46:02,049
I don't know what's going on here.

3027
01:46:02,855 --> 01:46:05,405
That's a little bit of a Gotta be careful.

3028
01:46:05,405 --> 01:46:06,245
It's big too.

3029
01:46:06,394 --> 01:46:06,575
I think

3030
01:46:07,115 --> 01:46:09,089
leah: Schmutz right here is, I think this right here is sch sch.

3031
01:46:09,089 --> 01:46:09,304
That might be

3032
01:46:09,304 --> 01:46:10,054
brian: a hepatic duct.

3033
01:46:11,134 --> 01:46:12,530
This, not this.

3034
01:46:12,634 --> 01:46:13,025
Oh, okay.

3035
01:46:13,085 --> 01:46:14,169
I was like, I think this is not bad.

3036
01:46:17,269 --> 01:46:18,509
leah: I wouldn't been making lot more noise.

3037
01:46:21,139 --> 01:46:21,429
Okay.

3038
01:46:21,429 --> 01:46:22,985
Yeah, that's interesting.

3039
01:46:25,174 --> 01:46:25,415
Okay.

3040
01:46:25,594 --> 01:46:26,075
All right.

3041
01:46:28,955 --> 01:46:29,075
Yep.

3042
01:46:31,025 --> 01:46:33,575
Just pushing up against what I think is the base of gallbladder.

3043
01:46:33,754 --> 01:46:33,875
brian: Yep.

3044
01:46:34,169 --> 01:46:36,214
As long as it doesn't curl in front of your tips, you're good.

3045
01:46:36,575 --> 01:46:37,115
Yes.

3046
01:46:37,325 --> 01:46:38,375
So you gotta be really careful.

3047
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:47,794
leah: Okay.

3048
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:48,940
Keep

3049
01:46:48,940 --> 01:46:49,339
brian: going though.

3050
01:46:49,474 --> 01:46:50,195
If you're gonna do it, do it.

3051
01:46:50,434 --> 01:46:50,674
leah: Yep.

3052
01:46:54,184 --> 01:46:54,695
brian: Nice.

3053
01:46:54,695 --> 01:46:55,504
I love that you pulled down.

3054
01:46:57,035 --> 01:46:57,245
That was

3055
01:46:57,245 --> 01:46:57,245
leah: great.

3056
01:46:57,245 --> 01:46:57,575
That was nothing.

3057
01:46:57,634 --> 01:46:58,115
Okay, great.

3058
01:46:58,294 --> 01:46:58,879
Yeah, that was great.

3059
01:46:59,134 --> 01:46:59,705
brian: That was really nice.

3060
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:01,080
Set of, that section was okay.

3061
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:01,080
Yeah.

3062
01:47:02,344 --> 01:47:03,035
Really advanced.

3063
01:47:03,335 --> 01:47:05,195
leah: Okay, great.

3064
01:47:07,144 --> 01:47:07,445
Okay.

3065
01:47:08,510 --> 01:47:08,690
All right.

3066
01:47:08,690 --> 01:47:11,660
I'm gonna take those bands and see what we see after we take those bands.

3067
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:11,960
Whoa.

3068
01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:17,870
Sorry.

3069
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:17,945
It's okay.

3070
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:31,840
Yeah.

3071
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:32,710
I'm not gonna go deep.

3072
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:32,800
Nice.

3073
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,390
But we had a little plane here.

3074
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:35,350
brian: Oh, that looked awesome.

3075
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:37,180
leah: Okay.

3076
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:38,980
Just seeing what we have.

3077
01:47:39,310 --> 01:47:39,490
brian: Totally.

3078
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:42,190
Yeah.

3079
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:42,550
I love that.

3080
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:43,130
Next section that we're doing.

3081
01:47:43,435 --> 01:47:44,651
There's, there's something under there.

3082
01:47:44,656 --> 01:47:45,635
Something that for sure.

3083
01:47:45,825 --> 01:47:47,035
There's something real over there.

3084
01:47:47,315 --> 01:47:47,635
I agree.

3085
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:50,339
leah: I'm just feeling.

3086
01:47:53,519 --> 01:47:53,790
Okay.

3087
01:47:55,049 --> 01:47:56,099
How about this?

3088
01:47:56,099 --> 01:47:56,790
Not bad.

3089
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,240
I think that's just bad.

3090
01:48:01,205 --> 01:48:01,495
brian: Okay.

3091
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:03,450
leah: But I'm still wiggling.

3092
01:48:04,884 --> 01:48:05,174
brian: Yeah.

3093
01:48:05,879 --> 01:48:07,014
Makes me feel reassured.

3094
01:48:07,375 --> 01:48:07,695
A little more.

3095
01:48:07,695 --> 01:48:09,360
A little more mobility there.

3096
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:11,519
leah: Yeah.

3097
01:48:11,519 --> 01:48:12,059
There's my tip.

3098
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:17,490
brian: Okay, good.

3099
01:48:18,839 --> 01:48:19,440
leah: Let's see what we have there.

3100
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:19,559
What's

3101
01:48:20,174 --> 01:48:20,495
brian: going on here?

3102
01:48:20,495 --> 01:48:21,214
This is kind of weird.

3103
01:48:21,625 --> 01:48:21,974
Weird.

3104
01:48:23,764 --> 01:48:24,054
Okay.

3105
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:28,049
leah: All right.

3106
01:48:28,049 --> 01:48:28,230
brian: Let's

3107
01:48:28,230 --> 01:48:28,440
leah: take a

3108
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:28,860
brian: peek.

3109
01:48:29,325 --> 01:48:32,160
Make, see small things and slow down.

3110
01:48:33,269 --> 01:48:37,495
Kind of like when we were like a little bit in our gallbladder, we're like, let's slow down.

3111
01:48:38,075 --> 01:48:38,495
brian: Mm-hmm.

3112
01:48:38,924 --> 01:48:39,214
Fast.

3113
01:48:39,214 --> 01:48:40,455
And Australia is slow on the curve, right?

3114
01:48:44,585 --> 01:48:46,554
That is, I dunno what that is.

3115
01:48:46,589 --> 01:48:48,155
Liver might be, liver.

3116
01:48:48,509 --> 01:48:49,349
Could just be liver

3117
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:53,790
leah: that feels like Pierce nim.

3118
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:56,500
I'm just gonna see.

3119
01:48:59,200 --> 01:48:59,349
Hmm.

3120
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:00,490
I wonder if I'm through

3121
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:01,660
brian: Yeah, that's what I wonder too.

3122
01:49:02,259 --> 01:49:03,669
That's my hypothesis right now.

3123
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:10,540
Times missing.

3124
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:18,129
brian: Left hand is key there.

3125
01:49:18,129 --> 01:49:20,169
They're push it a little more there.

3126
01:49:20,169 --> 01:49:20,410
They're without

3127
01:49:21,514 --> 01:49:21,714
leah: hitting.

3128
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:22,240
Okay.

3129
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,320
So I feel a little bit better.

3130
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:23,830
Yeah.

3131
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,889
We

3132
01:49:23,889 --> 01:49:25,209
brian: were just looking through a little bit of band para.

3133
01:49:25,269 --> 01:49:26,049
Yeah, I think so too.

3134
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:27,280
leah: So I'm gonna spread there.

3135
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:27,820
What you guys think too.

3136
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:28,330
Yeah.

3137
01:49:28,330 --> 01:49:32,950
I, I was gonna spread here and continue to open up that plate,

3138
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:40,599
brian: that move blind on liver capsule.

3139
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:43,450
I'll tell you some experience can cause a lot of bleeding.

3140
01:49:43,450 --> 01:49:44,379
Ah, okay.

3141
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:45,519
I don't wanna do that.

3142
01:49:45,519 --> 01:49:45,759
I've done it.

3143
01:49:46,419 --> 01:49:48,009
I've done it there that you can see it.

3144
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:48,669
That's, yeah.

3145
01:49:48,669 --> 01:49:50,500
Much better spread aggressively.

3146
01:49:50,889 --> 01:49:51,459
It doesn't matter.

3147
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:52,629
Right.

3148
01:49:52,809 --> 01:49:53,349
But you don't want to do.

3149
01:49:54,210 --> 01:49:54,809
Without seeing it.

3150
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:56,040
leah: Nice.

3151
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:56,549
Thanks Dagan.

3152
01:49:56,549 --> 01:49:57,120
Good driving.

3153
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:58,799
brian: Really good driving actually.

3154
01:49:58,799 --> 01:49:59,700
Yeah, you're doing great.

3155
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:02,910
Far, far above average.

3156
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:04,410
Uh, a plus.

3157
01:50:04,679 --> 01:50:06,120
I'm gonna give you an a plus for the rotation.

3158
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:06,389
Okay.

3159
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,370
I appreciate that's how you guys great, right?

3160
01:50:09,089 --> 01:50:10,019
I honestly have no idea.

3161
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:11,339
We go, it's not a plus.

3162
01:50:11,429 --> 01:50:11,880
I can show you.

3163
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:15,934
It's a vague system of honors and high honors.

3164
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:17,730
leah: Okay, great.

3165
01:50:18,150 --> 01:50:19,259
I feel better about that now.

3166
01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:21,089
Okay.

3167
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:24,240
Question is, is do we think this is anything?

3168
01:50:24,474 --> 01:50:24,695
brian: Yep.

3169
01:50:25,365 --> 01:50:26,255
That is the question.

3170
01:50:26,474 --> 01:50:28,889
So, yep.

3171
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:30,809
Pass some courage, but be cautious.

3172
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:32,730
That's it.

3173
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:35,520
Why'd you start so high?

3174
01:50:36,450 --> 01:50:38,675
leah: Because I thought I saw a liver bed in a band there, so, okay.

3175
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:39,690
I mean gallbladder.

3176
01:50:39,870 --> 01:50:41,130
brian: So I see this band here.

3177
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:41,195
Mm-hmm.

3178
01:50:41,275 --> 01:50:41,910
I don't know what it is.

3179
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:47,160
It's either base, gallbladder or it's some of other weird structure and you started above it and went across it, so.

3180
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:47,880
Oh, gotcha.

3181
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:48,995
I would be like, not the place I go.

3182
01:50:48,995 --> 01:50:49,155
Okay.

3183
01:50:49,155 --> 01:50:49,315
Okay.

3184
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:52,710
I would've gone just below it and see and then I would maybe work on that.

3185
01:50:52,715 --> 01:50:52,955
Okay.

3186
01:50:52,955 --> 01:50:52,957
You know?

3187
01:50:54,450 --> 01:50:55,170
leah: So maybe like here,

3188
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:58,530
come right below it.

3189
01:50:58,530 --> 01:50:59,040
Yeah.

3190
01:50:59,040 --> 01:50:59,430
I see.

3191
01:50:59,610 --> 01:51:00,030
Thank you.

3192
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:02,460
brian: Very productive.

3193
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:04,620
Very fast, Leo.

3194
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:06,240
See how fast that was?

3195
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,320
'cause you knew we didn't have this

3196
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:14,880
like med school green felt a little bit like line, is it anyway, where the points are made up and don't matter.

3197
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,330
I think that's

3198
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:16,740
leah: just fat right here.

3199
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:16,920
Yep.

3200
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:19,800
brian: You can rip it with a little bit bleed.

3201
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:20,970
You can pause and cut.

3202
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:22,470
Dealer's choice.

3203
01:51:25,170 --> 01:51:27,750
I feel like I wanna rip it, but it's all about consequence of bleeding.

3204
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,280
That's not a high consequence area.

3205
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:29,460
No.

3206
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,700
Well shoot exposure there is pretty good over here.

3207
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:36,180
On the other hand, I don't just rip things and have righting down everything.

3208
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,200
Right,

3209
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:37,500
leah: right, right.

3210
01:51:47,195 --> 01:51:47,344
Okay.

3211
01:51:48,335 --> 01:51:48,815
leah: All right.

3212
01:51:49,144 --> 01:51:49,625
What about that one?

3213
01:51:49,714 --> 01:51:50,375
I think that's Schmitz.

3214
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:50,644
Yeah.

3215
01:51:51,695 --> 01:51:51,995
brian: Feel it.

3216
01:51:52,144 --> 01:51:53,434
But it looked like Schmitz before.

3217
01:51:54,634 --> 01:51:55,264
Feel it when you're good.

3218
01:51:56,105 --> 01:51:57,964
And then while you have hooking, see what else you can do.

3219
01:51:59,075 --> 01:51:59,585
Put it behind.

3220
01:52:01,174 --> 01:52:01,625
That's nothing.

3221
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:01,955
Burger.

3222
01:52:03,485 --> 01:52:03,575
leah: What?

3223
01:52:03,575 --> 01:52:04,955
That shaky hand had my cell.

3224
01:52:04,955 --> 01:52:05,105
Huh?

3225
01:52:06,514 --> 01:52:07,745
brian: Explore some shit too.

3226
01:52:08,644 --> 01:52:09,309
That's gonna be nothing.

3227
01:52:09,469 --> 01:52:10,830
Burger as I predict.

3228
01:52:13,474 --> 01:52:14,495
Little still thick.

3229
01:52:14,495 --> 01:52:14,795
leah: Yeah.

3230
01:52:14,795 --> 01:52:16,355
I'm gonna come through that first.

3231
01:52:18,035 --> 01:52:20,554
I'll probably come out and scrub in my Maryland just to make myself feel better.

3232
01:52:20,915 --> 01:52:21,065
brian: Kind.

3233
01:52:21,065 --> 01:52:21,155
Worry.

3234
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:21,990
What the hell that is?

3235
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:23,190
leah: Yeah.

3236
01:52:23,469 --> 01:52:23,830
I don't know.

3237
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:24,429
We're

3238
01:52:24,429 --> 01:52:24,629
brian: looking

3239
01:52:25,139 --> 01:52:25,629
leah: exactly

3240
01:52:27,339 --> 01:52:27,629
brian: blue.

3241
01:52:29,464 --> 01:52:32,629
Yeah, it probably is that, that would be like if I had to make a wave,

3242
01:52:32,945 --> 01:52:33,754
I was like, maybe.

3243
01:52:33,754 --> 01:52:35,855
But it also like under the colors, like really?

3244
01:52:35,884 --> 01:52:36,424
Here's another move.

3245
01:52:36,424 --> 01:52:37,924
We grab it

3246
01:52:38,344 --> 01:52:40,325
brian: gently and slide down just to a break.

3247
01:52:40,415 --> 01:52:40,835
It's fat.

3248
01:52:40,835 --> 01:52:43,264
It'll, it'll, it'll gradually disintegrate.

3249
01:52:43,559 --> 01:52:44,349
Don't vols it.

3250
01:52:44,349 --> 01:52:44,830
You know what I mean?

3251
01:52:45,514 --> 01:52:46,144
Don't grab so hard.

3252
01:52:46,144 --> 01:52:46,804
You're gonna vols.

3253
01:52:46,894 --> 01:52:47,045
Yeah.

3254
01:52:48,065 --> 01:52:48,665
Let it slide.

3255
01:52:48,964 --> 01:52:49,085
Yeah.

3256
01:52:49,085 --> 01:52:49,924
It should be sliding.

3257
01:52:50,045 --> 01:52:51,184
And you're gonna open and do it again.

3258
01:52:51,275 --> 01:52:53,884
Slide, slide, slide.

3259
01:52:57,094 --> 01:52:57,830
Not really fat, huh?

3260
01:52:58,730 --> 01:52:59,910
It almost looks a little thicker.

3261
01:52:59,910 --> 01:53:01,804
Like some sort of weird, like accessory.

3262
01:53:02,615 --> 01:53:03,304
leah: That's what I'm wondering.

3263
01:53:03,304 --> 01:53:03,905
Yeah, it's,

3264
01:53:05,259 --> 01:53:05,825
it's odd.

3265
01:53:05,825 --> 01:53:06,670
I dunno to do with that one.

3266
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:12,370
Well, it looks like maybe like a weird accessory, like could be artery, like a posterior.

3267
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:16,450
leah: Just trying to thin this out and see if we can see a structure in there versus just more fat.

3268
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,070
brian: So your time bounced.

3269
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:18,519
Good?

3270
01:53:18,525 --> 01:53:18,684
Yep.

3271
01:53:18,835 --> 01:53:19,125
leah: Good

3272
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:19,480
brian: job.

3273
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:20,650
I did see it that time.

3274
01:53:20,655 --> 01:53:20,965
I'm glad

3275
01:53:22,565 --> 01:53:22,844
leah: I do.

3276
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:24,429
I hopefully could learn.

3277
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:24,969
Okay.

3278
01:53:25,809 --> 01:53:26,650
Nice coaching.

3279
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:29,335
Nice, nice, nice.

3280
01:53:30,429 --> 01:53:31,030
I'm just staying in that.

3281
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:32,295
You a good athlete of some kind.

3282
01:53:32,295 --> 01:53:32,950
I can't remember really.

3283
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:35,469
Um, yeah, not in college.

3284
01:53:35,469 --> 01:53:35,530
No.

3285
01:53:36,790 --> 01:53:37,330
No.

3286
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,019
What did you do before?

3287
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:43,599
leah: Uh, volleyball and track.

3288
01:53:43,929 --> 01:53:44,110
Nice.

3289
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:45,160
That was really good.

3290
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:45,610
brian: Dissection.

3291
01:53:47,139 --> 01:53:48,370
leah: This is nothing here.

3292
01:53:48,910 --> 01:53:49,269
brian: It sure is nothing.

3293
01:53:49,269 --> 01:53:52,030
It might be a little like emphatic or something, right?

3294
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:52,450
leah: Yeah.

3295
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:53,080
I can burn it.

3296
01:53:53,139 --> 01:53:53,349
brian: Yeah.

3297
01:53:53,349 --> 01:53:56,620
I above that one just 'cause it looks like a structure of some kind before I switch.

3298
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:58,300
I was gonna just see, see there's something back there.

3299
01:53:58,960 --> 01:53:59,825
Feel, I dunno.

3300
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:00,910
I shouldn't make predictions.

3301
01:54:02,165 --> 01:54:02,385
Yes.

3302
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:04,000
Engage the tips though.

3303
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:05,860
You not pushing hard enough and do it.

3304
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:06,519
leah: Oh shoot.

3305
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:09,250
It is rolling off my tips.

3306
01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:09,610
So

3307
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:16,855
posters moving like it's floppy so I dunno.

3308
01:54:20,795 --> 01:54:21,054
All right.

3309
01:54:21,059 --> 01:54:24,010
I'm gonna take that first one since it's bothering me and then we can see it better.

3310
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:27,610
We're getting close.

3311
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:28,240
We're doing it.

3312
01:54:33,525 --> 01:54:33,855
Go.

3313
01:54:34,365 --> 01:54:34,724
There we go.

3314
01:54:39,884 --> 01:54:40,035
Okay.

3315
01:54:41,594 --> 01:54:41,894
There we go.

3316
01:54:41,894 --> 01:54:41,897
There we go.

3317
01:54:42,405 --> 01:54:42,855
All right.

3318
01:54:42,974 --> 01:54:43,455
Let's see.

3319
01:54:43,544 --> 01:54:43,929
I gonna feel

3320
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,969
It's starting to look like something more, isn't it?

3321
01:54:47,235 --> 01:54:48,286
leah: Yeah, it actually is.

3322
01:54:48,945 --> 01:54:50,174
Almost looks like a little vessel.

3323
01:54:50,745 --> 01:54:53,294
brian: It does, but it's entirely in the wrong direction.

3324
01:54:53,504 --> 01:54:56,504
I would've, if I had it bet, I would still say it's nothing but.

3325
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:59,280
Like, it's not high enough confidence that we just blast it.

3326
01:54:59,519 --> 01:54:59,940
leah: Same.

3327
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:00,870
brian: You know,

3328
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:02,880
leah: I'm not gonna, I, how

3329
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:03,690
brian: are we gonna dissect it?

3330
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:05,250
It's like floppy and difficult.

3331
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:07,230
It's not a bad idea.

3332
01:55:09,090 --> 01:55:11,160
leah: So it feels like there's a fat line there.

3333
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:14,280
brian: I mean, I guess you can try and engage your chips, right?

3334
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:15,660
I don't know what the hell that is.

3335
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:17,040
Try and strip this down maybe.

3336
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:17,670
Okay.

3337
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:20,970
You know, see if we get better exposure to it goes to.

3338
01:55:23,130 --> 01:55:26,040
It's so floppy that I can't imagine it's a real structure.

3339
01:55:32,445 --> 01:55:32,735
Nice.

3340
01:55:33,525 --> 01:55:34,015
Perfect.

3341
01:55:41,835 --> 01:55:42,215
leah: Got it.

3342
01:55:42,295 --> 01:55:44,820
Almost like, is it something, I don't know.

3343
01:55:44,825 --> 01:55:45,215
brian: I don't know.

3344
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,420
I like I told you, if I had the bed, I'd say no, but I kind of pulsing.

3345
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:49,260
Yeah.

3346
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:50,850
It looks like a, it's pulsing.

3347
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:51,720
Do we think it's pulsing?

3348
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:52,741
It's probably a posterior branch.

3349
01:55:53,445 --> 01:55:53,735
Okay.

3350
01:55:53,885 --> 01:55:54,930
It's definitely pulsing.

3351
01:55:54,930 --> 01:55:56,400
I just finally, yeah, I see it.

3352
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,150
Yeah, right there.

3353
01:55:57,150 --> 01:55:57,735
So I, that little posse right there?

3354
01:55:57,845 --> 01:55:58,455
Yeah, right here.

3355
01:56:00,325 --> 01:56:00,615
Well,

3356
01:56:00,615 --> 01:56:01,535
leah: I lid That's

3357
01:56:01,535 --> 01:56:01,695
brian: wrong.

3358
01:56:03,345 --> 01:56:03,895
There you go.

3359
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:07,350
I really engage that though.

3360
01:56:08,595 --> 01:56:09,535
But don't make big moves.

3361
01:56:11,275 --> 01:56:12,935
Get over overcharged.

3362
01:56:17,175 --> 01:56:17,575
I dunno.

3363
01:56:17,855 --> 01:56:18,175
I don't know.

3364
01:56:20,755 --> 01:56:21,695
Uh, can't.

3365
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:22,297
I can't, I can't.

3366
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:23,160
You

3367
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,090
leah: wanna come take a feel or it

3368
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:24,840
brian: better?

3369
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:25,290
Yeah.

3370
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,210
Keep working over more medial though.

3371
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:27,480
Okay.

3372
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:28,650
There's stuff there to do.

3373
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:33,540
leah: Is there more stuff to do?

3374
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:36,180
I dunno what else there is to do

3375
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:36,330
because

3376
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:38,790
leah: I think we can come across just

3377
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:39,060
brian: grabbing

3378
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:39,390
your gown.

3379
01:56:39,575 --> 01:56:39,955
Oh, thanks.

3380
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:41,160
brian: Oh, maybe I can clear those.

3381
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:44,974
It's okay

3382
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:45,485
brian: scrubbed.

3383
01:56:46,025 --> 01:56:46,505
No, it's fine.

3384
01:56:46,894 --> 01:56:47,974
I'm just like Sandy, I don't want

3385
01:56:56,615 --> 01:56:59,764
leah: just coming around the backside of the duct, like hugging on it with my tips

3386
01:57:00,905 --> 01:57:01,835
and getting, you know, so much.

3387
01:57:02,165 --> 01:57:03,365
That way you can actually get around it.

3388
01:57:03,424 --> 01:57:04,205
Yeah, exactly.

3389
01:57:09,225 --> 01:57:09,615
I would love,

3390
01:57:13,905 --> 01:57:15,405
you know what, I would love to do

3391
01:57:18,045 --> 01:57:21,705
simulation using your kind that size.

3392
01:57:22,515 --> 01:57:22,845
Yeah.

3393
01:57:22,935 --> 01:57:24,735
Like I'm hugging around, um, the back

3394
01:57:26,355 --> 01:57:31,785
leah: and like kind of rolling off the back, feeling it, and
then trying to get that spread through that tissue behind it.

3395
01:57:35,895 --> 01:57:36,255
Yeah.

3396
01:57:36,255 --> 01:57:36,585
Nice.

3397
01:57:36,585 --> 01:57:37,005
There we go.

3398
01:57:37,155 --> 01:57:39,765
Kind of coming a little bit check and see, but how was the lady from yesterday doing?

3399
01:57:40,725 --> 01:57:40,845
Oh,

3400
01:57:40,845 --> 01:57:41,475
leah: she's doing okay.

3401
01:57:41,475 --> 01:57:43,155
She's still, they kept her intubated overnight.

3402
01:57:43,425 --> 01:57:44,955
She's under Nore at 0.08.

3403
01:57:45,285 --> 01:57:45,885
They're gonna ween her.

3404
01:57:46,215 --> 01:57:52,005
They weaned her sedation a bit and she was like following commands
her kidney function that, you know, it was at 6.6 when it peaked.

3405
01:57:52,305 --> 01:57:53,775
Yeah, it's down to four point.

3406
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:57,225
Um, like three for creatinine, lactate's down to 2.1.

3407
01:57:57,225 --> 01:57:57,315
Nice.

3408
01:57:58,605 --> 01:57:59,355
Um, I,

3409
01:57:59,355 --> 01:58:01,180
it was definitely gonna be a bit for her to recover after all.

3410
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:01,620
Oh yeah.

3411
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:02,715
I mean, totally.

3412
01:58:02,715 --> 01:58:04,965
She was the sepsis besides the ballet.

3413
01:58:06,525 --> 01:58:06,705
That's,

3414
01:58:08,685 --> 01:58:09,195
brian: that's cool.

3415
01:58:09,555 --> 01:58:09,795
Yeah.

3416
01:58:09,975 --> 01:58:11,775
leah: I'm assuming you'll regrab Dr. George.

3417
01:58:11,895 --> 01:58:13,425
brian: Lemme just figure out what the hell that thing is.

3418
01:58:13,965 --> 01:58:14,715
That's weird, huh?

3419
01:58:14,775 --> 01:58:14,955
leah: Yeah.

3420
01:58:14,955 --> 01:58:15,260
Very weird.

3421
01:58:16,345 --> 01:58:19,855
Puls a tile, if you will back.

3422
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,655
I'll take Marilyn.

3423
01:58:21,715 --> 01:58:22,110
You got it.

3424
01:58:22,735 --> 01:58:23,335
I'll just stand it there.

3425
01:58:23,335 --> 01:58:25,465
Marilyn, do you want that step out of the way?

3426
01:58:26,095 --> 01:58:26,365
brian: Me?

3427
01:58:26,605 --> 01:58:26,785
Yes.

3428
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:27,805
I kind of like it was.

3429
01:58:27,805 --> 01:58:28,195
She's right.

3430
01:58:28,255 --> 01:58:28,855
Yeah, it's nice.

3431
01:58:29,275 --> 01:58:29,367
It's good stuff.

3432
01:58:29,367 --> 01:58:32,815
In fact, that was a learning point for me in this case, was that I should have suggested you get a step.

3433
01:58:32,845 --> 01:58:34,705
'cause I did notice your shoulder was really high.

3434
01:58:34,705 --> 01:58:35,245
Yeah, me too.

3435
01:58:35,245 --> 01:58:37,675
And she felt like it was wrong and immediately corrected.

3436
01:58:37,675 --> 01:58:38,455
You wouldn't know that.

3437
01:58:38,515 --> 01:58:39,865
So that was a failure on my part.

3438
01:58:40,525 --> 01:58:41,190
Well, I guess mine too.

3439
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:42,349
That was my learning point for today.

3440
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:42,870
One of them.

3441
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:44,875
No, I was like, I was like awkward.

3442
01:58:45,175 --> 01:58:48,715
Like I wasn't sure if it was something that I was doing, you know what I mean?

3443
01:58:49,045 --> 01:58:51,790
Positioning wise of myself or not.

3444
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:52,190
Nice.

3445
01:58:52,190 --> 01:58:52,471
It's a

3446
01:58:52,476 --> 01:58:54,385
leah: good angle for the um, clips.

3447
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:03,505
brian: Okay, so that's nothing because I'm going from easier stuff to harder.

3448
01:59:03,715 --> 01:59:03,925
Mm-hmm.

3449
01:59:04,585 --> 01:59:04,764
Okay.

3450
01:59:04,764 --> 01:59:05,875
That's something we can take

3451
01:59:08,335 --> 01:59:10,855
get there almost entirely off.

3452
01:59:10,974 --> 01:59:11,755
It's so floppy.

3453
01:59:11,995 --> 01:59:12,505
That's awesome.

3454
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:15,330
It's got that.

3455
02:00:15,330 --> 02:00:16,830
It's got this handle thing.

3456
02:00:16,934 --> 02:00:17,224
Yeah.

3457
02:00:22,315 --> 02:00:22,605
Okay.

3458
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:29,670
leah: Oh, nice.

3459
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:30,030
Yeah.

3460
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:30,629
Okay.

3461
02:00:30,665 --> 02:00:31,205
brian: Put that on.

3462
02:00:31,554 --> 02:00:37,110
Yeah, but I don't here to put that on stretch so I dissect a little more up.

3463
02:00:38,490 --> 02:00:39,990
Put that on stretch because I can't do anything.

3464
02:00:40,559 --> 02:00:40,889
Oh, nice.

3465
02:00:41,519 --> 02:00:42,330
leah: Yeah, that looks good.

3466
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:44,610
You see that cat bad

3467
02:00:45,394 --> 02:00:45,615
hat?

3468
02:00:47,849 --> 02:00:48,240
That's

3469
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:52,260
leah: nothing compared to me.

3470
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:52,769
I think.

3471
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:58,110
Oh, that's really pretty.

3472
02:00:58,110 --> 02:00:58,860
That's nice.

3473
02:00:58,860 --> 02:00:59,040
Mm-hmm.

3474
02:01:02,849 --> 02:01:03,300
Yeah.

3475
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:04,769
Dr. George's grip is a,

3476
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:07,230
brian: it's a lot of, it's 10,000 little things, guys.

3477
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:07,980
There's no mystery here.

3478
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:08,340
Okay.

3479
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:08,400
Yeah.

3480
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,450
It's not rocket science.

3481
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:10,410
It's not talent.

3482
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:11,760
It isn't.

3483
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:12,840
It's deliberate practice.

3484
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:13,080
Folks.

3485
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:14,670
Send the details for years, right?

3486
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:15,000
That's all.

3487
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,815
It's okay.

3488
02:01:17,394 --> 02:01:18,179
No secrets here.

3489
02:01:24,059 --> 02:01:26,400
Okay, so now we got that on a stretch, right?

3490
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:26,490
Mm-hmm.

3491
02:01:26,730 --> 02:01:27,120
Which is my goal

3492
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:28,740
leah: going directly into gallbladder.

3493
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:29,455
It's where we're going into gallbladder.

3494
02:01:29,460 --> 02:01:29,790
Yeah.

3495
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:31,615
So directly into gallbladder on back.

3496
02:01:32,519 --> 02:01:32,550
Okay.

3497
02:01:40,735 --> 02:01:41,605
Grab it like he did.

3498
02:01:41,605 --> 02:01:42,115
Probably not.

3499
02:01:43,765 --> 02:01:45,720
This is a weird little posterior branch, I guess.

3500
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:48,530
leah: Yeah.

3501
02:01:48,655 --> 02:01:49,015
Thank you.

3502
02:01:55,525 --> 02:01:55,825
Okay.

3503
02:01:57,445 --> 02:01:58,885
Good to clip it and take it?

3504
02:01:59,875 --> 02:02:00,175
brian: Yeah.

3505
02:02:00,385 --> 02:02:00,595
leah: Okay.

3506
02:02:00,805 --> 02:02:01,825
I'll take the clip applier.

3507
02:02:01,825 --> 02:02:01,885
Yeah.

3508
02:02:02,305 --> 02:02:02,905
brian: Yeah, for sure.

3509
02:02:03,415 --> 02:02:05,515
I wanna take that posterior branch.

3510
02:02:05,515 --> 02:02:06,080
Pick that too, I think.

3511
02:02:06,270 --> 02:02:06,560
Okay.

3512
02:02:06,590 --> 02:02:08,360
I'll, if you think it's skeletonized,

3513
02:02:09,145 --> 02:02:09,805
leah: I, yeah.

3514
02:02:09,805 --> 02:02:10,945
I got my tines around it.

3515
02:02:11,485 --> 02:02:11,515
Okay.

3516
02:02:11,515 --> 02:02:12,505
While you're, but I'll show you.

3517
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:12,760
brian: Okay.

3518
02:02:13,915 --> 02:02:14,240
You don't have to show me that.

3519
02:02:16,430 --> 02:02:18,415
I need to prove, just to know what you think.

3520
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:22,870
Okay.

3521
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:24,145
Now you get to redeem yourself.

3522
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:27,630
Gonna stack, there we go.

3523
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:27,950
Right.

3524
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:29,110
Partial close.

3525
02:02:29,110 --> 02:02:29,270
Yes.

3526
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,545
It's gonna be

3527
02:02:29,545 --> 02:02:30,025
leah: perfect.

3528
02:02:30,025 --> 02:02:30,805
brian: Partial, close.

3529
02:02:31,435 --> 02:02:32,695
leah: Make it in, maybe partial, close.

3530
02:02:32,695 --> 02:02:33,385
Slide it down

3531
02:02:33,655 --> 02:02:35,605
brian: so you kind of see it in your thing a little bit.

3532
02:02:35,755 --> 02:02:35,845
leah: Mm-hmm.

3533
02:02:37,615 --> 02:02:38,185
brian: Or feel it.

3534
02:02:38,305 --> 02:02:38,785
leah: I feel it.

3535
02:02:40,855 --> 02:02:41,125
brian: Perfect.

3536
02:02:41,515 --> 02:02:42,655
leah: Could have been a little better 'cause I started.

3537
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:43,020
No, that's

3538
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:43,140
brian: perfect.

3539
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:43,740
Whatcha promise?

3540
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:46,255
leah: Oh, no, I mean, I started, uh, I started pulling on it.

3541
02:02:47,215 --> 02:02:47,425
Oh.

3542
02:02:47,425 --> 02:02:48,835
So my tissue handling could have been better.

3543
02:02:49,255 --> 02:02:49,645
brian: All the way up.

3544
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:50,060
All the way up.

3545
02:02:50,185 --> 02:02:51,025
Move yourself out to light.

3546
02:02:51,375 --> 02:02:52,365
And it's fire.

3547
02:02:53,775 --> 02:02:54,765
And you can see your tip there.

3548
02:02:55,215 --> 02:02:55,425
Yep.

3549
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:55,755
Just do it.

3550
02:02:56,025 --> 02:02:56,985
You don't need to make it slow.

3551
02:02:56,985 --> 02:02:57,225
There.

3552
02:02:57,465 --> 02:02:58,275
The specimen side.

3553
02:02:58,275 --> 02:02:58,545
Scissors.

3554
02:02:58,755 --> 02:02:59,085
Thank you.

3555
02:02:59,505 --> 02:03:00,225
That's a straightaway.

3556
02:03:01,245 --> 02:03:01,545
leah: Okay.

3557
02:03:02,025 --> 02:03:03,315
When we talk about my velocity.

3558
02:03:03,315 --> 02:03:04,005
Yes.

3559
02:03:12,945 --> 02:03:13,065
brian: Yeah.

3560
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:14,805
There was a little branch up in there and that's what that is.

3561
02:03:14,805 --> 02:03:15,705
You just cut through it, right?

3562
02:03:15,915 --> 02:03:16,215
Yep.

3563
02:03:16,335 --> 02:03:20,325
It was a weird little, I dunno, weird an anatomy here.

3564
02:03:20,505 --> 02:03:24,615
leah: I'm gonna just check and make sure I can get across this duct Well.

3565
02:03:36,045 --> 02:03:38,805
brian: See now it's when you see that, see that splays out a little bit.

3566
02:03:38,805 --> 02:03:39,135
Yeah.

3567
02:03:39,135 --> 02:03:39,675
At the bottom.

3568
02:03:39,735 --> 02:03:40,065
Yeah.

3569
02:03:40,275 --> 02:03:41,265
So I wonder, okay.

3570
02:03:41,265 --> 02:03:42,045
Yeah, exactly.

3571
02:03:42,045 --> 02:03:42,765
Where are we gonna go?

3572
02:03:42,765 --> 02:03:44,505
Is that the actual confluence?

3573
02:03:44,505 --> 02:03:44,985
Not sure.

3574
02:03:49,445 --> 02:03:49,594
leah: Hmm.

3575
02:03:50,915 --> 02:04:00,509
Do you use the big clip of wire or you use that same Uh, well, like the big white one, the
hemo lock is maybe what we want to do here because it's, yeah, I think we do want, okay.

3576
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:00,950
Purple

3577
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:01,549
brian: HELOC please.

3578
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:04,030
Thank you.

3579
02:04:05,549 --> 02:04:07,714
leah: May I see another, um, grasper real quick saying something?

3580
02:04:07,759 --> 02:04:08,049
Yeah.

3581
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:09,570
That also just felt like it,

3582
02:04:09,769 --> 02:04:10,450
brian: a good leadership

3583
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:16,264
because I was thinking about how to work around with a clip that's not safe.

3584
02:04:16,415 --> 02:04:17,224
It's just better to do Right.

3585
02:04:17,299 --> 02:04:17,460
Thing

3586
02:04:20,705 --> 02:04:20,884
done

3587
02:04:20,884 --> 02:04:21,184
leah: there.

3588
02:04:22,655 --> 02:04:23,224
So smart.

3589
02:04:24,304 --> 02:04:24,545
Yeah.

3590
02:04:24,545 --> 02:04:28,054
Well, I knew I had a bad angle and I didn't like my grab.

3591
02:04:30,905 --> 02:04:31,054
brian: Yeah.

3592
02:04:31,054 --> 02:04:35,105
So you see how it's slinging out a little bit where the co I think confluence is Yep.

3593
02:04:35,195 --> 02:04:35,615
Right there.

3594
02:04:35,615 --> 02:04:36,820
So you're gonna say half a millimeter above that.

3595
02:04:36,875 --> 02:04:37,115
Okay.

3596
02:04:37,610 --> 02:04:37,900
Okay.

3597
02:04:38,434 --> 02:04:38,735
Please.

3598
02:04:39,485 --> 02:04:43,625
Oh, I can see now where like that narrowing is and then there's that And that's the confluence over there.

3599
02:04:43,655 --> 02:04:44,525
Yeah, exactly right.

3600
02:04:44,525 --> 02:04:45,724
It could be, could be.

3601
02:04:45,724 --> 02:04:46,835
But this is the narrowing hearing.

3602
02:04:46,835 --> 02:04:47,825
You're gonna wanna go this way.

3603
02:04:48,155 --> 02:04:48,575
That's, that's right.

3604
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:48,960
Exactly.

3605
02:04:49,219 --> 02:04:50,945
brian: And not that it is, that it could be.

3606
02:04:50,974 --> 02:04:51,005
Okay.

3607
02:04:51,815 --> 02:04:52,054
Okay.

3608
02:04:52,205 --> 02:04:57,575
I was doing probability with my daughter last night and I was
talking about how reality is all about, like, you don't know, am I

3609
02:04:57,575 --> 02:04:58,924
leah: pushing a hair more with your Yep.

3610
02:04:59,554 --> 02:04:59,764
Yeah.

3611
02:04:59,974 --> 02:05:00,365
Perfect.

3612
02:05:00,365 --> 02:05:01,295
brian: Probabilistic reasoning.

3613
02:05:02,554 --> 02:05:07,594
So there's zero tolerance for error there, so we just err on the side of caution.

3614
02:05:08,134 --> 02:05:08,464
Perfect.

3615
02:05:09,695 --> 02:05:12,530
Kind of like how the physicists and their, uh, like what we were talking about.

3616
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:13,009
Yeah.

3617
02:05:13,009 --> 02:05:14,170
brian: There's no six Sigma here.

3618
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:17,410
We don't get that usually.

3619
02:05:17,559 --> 02:05:17,620
Um,

3620
02:05:18,640 --> 02:05:20,410
probability for fun or does she have homework?

3621
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:21,430
brian: Not for fun.

3622
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,790
Uh, so I homeschooled her last year.

3623
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:25,394
I took her year off.

3624
02:05:25,434 --> 02:05:25,955
I homeschooled her.

3625
02:05:26,170 --> 02:05:31,030
The only chapter we didn't do in our geometry was, this doesn't make any sense probability.

3626
02:05:32,050 --> 02:05:34,600
And so the school was mad at me 'cause I had skipped it.

3627
02:05:36,255 --> 02:05:38,434
So I, we waited for the summer.

3628
02:05:38,975 --> 02:05:39,850
So we have nice

3629
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:42,010
leah: cool little anatomy with that posterior branch.

3630
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:43,059
brian: Do what?

3631
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:45,280
leah: The anatomy with the little posterior branch.

3632
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:45,970
It's nice to see.

3633
02:05:46,450 --> 02:05:46,660
Oh.

3634
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:47,650
Always scared.

3635
02:05:47,650 --> 02:05:49,000
I'm gonna get burned by one of those.

3636
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:49,900
I dig in back there.

3637
02:05:51,785 --> 02:05:52,394
brian: It's good to see that.

3638
02:05:53,665 --> 02:05:54,225
I supposed to do

3639
02:05:54,455 --> 02:05:54,905
leah: clip clip.

3640
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:57,590
Cut off the Foss.

3641
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:58,520
brian: Yeah.

3642
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:02,510
Thank God she's back from public school.

3643
02:06:04,670 --> 02:06:05,120
God bless.

3644
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:05,360
Teachers.

3645
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:05,600
You did

3646
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,830
homeschooling for one year?

3647
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:09,265
brian: Yeah, I took a year off and we lived in an rv.

3648
02:06:09,265 --> 02:06:09,545
Oh yeah.

3649
02:06:09,765 --> 02:06:10,585
So we had to homeschool.

3650
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:14,030
We did a terrible job.

3651
02:06:15,645 --> 02:06:15,865
Job.

3652
02:06:15,890 --> 02:06:18,830
I did a drill job on everything but geometry.

3653
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:20,390
I filled it with geometry.

3654
02:06:23,690 --> 02:06:24,470
Where'd you guys travel?

3655
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:26,420
Mostly out last we were climbing.

3656
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:26,990
So nice.

3657
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:27,890
Appreciate teachers.

3658
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:29,840
brian: Yeah.

3659
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:34,910
I mean, I've always appreciated teachers, but I really appreciate It's really hard.

3660
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:34,970
You

3661
02:06:35,105 --> 02:06:35,265
good?

3662
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:39,620
Yeah, no, I was gonna say, I never truly came to appreciate our, like some of the stats programs.

3663
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,040
All I had to do was put the data and I didn't have to calculate any of those.

3664
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:45,110
Like, you know what I mean?

3665
02:06:45,410 --> 02:06:47,480
brian: You're like, why did I need to know Data error.

3666
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,950
No, I mean it's like important to know it, but I'm like, I don't want to have to like, you know what I mean?

3667
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:54,590
Like having to calculate all that stuff.

3668
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:57,320
I just remember with like genetics and everything, how we were doing that.

3669
02:06:57,320 --> 02:06:59,060
Oh, it was painful.

3670
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:02,390
brian: One of my very close friends is doing his PhD right now.

3671
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:04,400
He's taking a very high level stats.

3672
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:06,765
He's like God's gift to me when I'm doing research.

3673
02:07:06,765 --> 02:07:07,125
It's cool.

3674
02:07:07,285 --> 02:07:07,405
A

3675
02:07:07,405 --> 02:07:11,330
very good biostatistic biostatistician work for weight and gold.

3676
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:14,540
leah: That's for sure.

3677
02:07:16,275 --> 02:07:20,955
brian: I, so I did a master's education, but it was really a master's in Stats for education.

3678
02:07:20,955 --> 02:07:22,455
So I really love stats.

3679
02:07:23,205 --> 02:07:24,915
leah: Little hooky part, you know, goes in the back.

3680
02:07:24,974 --> 02:07:25,125
Mm-hmm.

3681
02:07:25,455 --> 02:07:28,514
So I always fix that before I get in so I don't have to puts around.

3682
02:07:29,804 --> 02:07:30,045
brian: Okay.

3683
02:07:30,075 --> 02:07:30,945
Perfectly loaded.

3684
02:07:30,945 --> 02:07:31,365
Thank you.

3685
02:07:34,605 --> 02:07:34,905
leah: Okay.

3686
02:07:34,905 --> 02:07:35,804
Wanna see the back?

3687
02:07:35,804 --> 02:07:36,105
All right.

3688
02:07:36,105 --> 02:07:38,054
Now let's look to the confluence.

3689
02:07:39,464 --> 02:07:39,554
Nice.

3690
02:07:39,554 --> 02:07:42,674
I think about right there.

3691
02:07:42,735 --> 02:07:43,004
Yeah.

3692
02:07:43,004 --> 02:07:43,589
brian: I think that's great.

3693
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:47,850
Good job.

3694
02:07:48,580 --> 02:07:49,730
Those are lovely, aren't they?

3695
02:07:49,850 --> 02:07:50,445
leah: I like 'em a lot.

3696
02:07:50,835 --> 02:07:51,490
I just, I'll think another piece.

3697
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:51,930
Secure,

3698
02:07:52,860 --> 02:07:54,050
especially with me too.

3699
02:07:54,290 --> 02:07:54,970
I feel very secure.

3700
02:07:55,035 --> 02:07:56,805
This is actually, she had dilated ducts and

3701
02:07:56,805 --> 02:07:58,725
leah: she has that stint like she needs She could pressure.

3702
02:07:58,725 --> 02:07:59,205
Exactly.

3703
02:07:59,360 --> 02:07:59,650
Yeah.

3704
02:07:59,655 --> 02:07:59,895
Yeah.

3705
02:07:59,985 --> 02:08:00,250
This is great.

3706
02:08:00,290 --> 02:08:00,890
I don't wanna sit.

3707
02:08:01,460 --> 02:08:02,530
Let's put four of them on.

3708
02:08:03,735 --> 02:08:05,295
I can't tell if you're serious or kidding.

3709
02:08:05,295 --> 02:08:05,685
Not serious.

3710
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:06,130
Okay.

3711
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:11,715
Putting, like, you lined up your clip before you went in.

3712
02:08:11,835 --> 02:08:12,135
leah: Yeah.

3713
02:08:12,135 --> 02:08:13,635
I like to go in and get it on the back.

3714
02:08:13,785 --> 02:08:14,535
brian: Oh, she switched it.

3715
02:08:14,895 --> 02:08:15,825
So the angle's different.

3716
02:08:16,155 --> 02:08:16,245
Mm-hmm.

3717
02:08:16,785 --> 02:08:20,265
So she had the backside on the, what is now the, the tearing towards you.

3718
02:08:20,270 --> 02:08:20,410
Yeah.

3719
02:08:20,430 --> 02:08:21,555
You gotta come, come out.

3720
02:08:21,975 --> 02:08:25,215
Because what changed now is you have it facing down.

3721
02:08:25,515 --> 02:08:25,635
Mm-hmm.

3722
02:08:25,875 --> 02:08:27,555
You want the knob behind your duct, right?

3723
02:08:27,555 --> 02:08:27,645
Yep.

3724
02:08:28,155 --> 02:08:32,055
But now you have it facing down and your angle across the duct is not the same.

3725
02:08:32,385 --> 02:08:32,655
Okay.

3726
02:08:32,865 --> 02:08:34,250
Before she loaded, I'm gonna come fully out.

3727
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:35,170
Okay.

3728
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:36,645
Come out and have it reloaded.

3729
02:08:36,855 --> 02:08:36,885
Okay.

3730
02:08:37,335 --> 02:08:40,425
So we're gonna want to, so this one's here.

3731
02:08:40,425 --> 02:08:40,485
Yeah.

3732
02:08:40,485 --> 02:08:41,890
So knob on that side.

3733
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:43,370
leah: Thanks.

3734
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:50,445
And Dr. George, are you gonna take off the fossa?

3735
02:08:51,585 --> 02:08:52,965
brian: Yeah, I'll do that if you don't mind.

3736
02:08:52,965 --> 02:08:52,967
Yeah, yeah.

3737
02:08:52,967 --> 02:08:52,968
Course.

3738
02:08:52,968 --> 02:08:53,060
Because it'll be done.

3739
02:08:54,465 --> 02:08:55,575
leah: Just figured I'd clarify.

3740
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:55,870
brian: Perfect.

3741
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:57,795
Uh, not, not perfect.

3742
02:08:59,505 --> 02:09:00,015
We'll try it.

3743
02:09:00,075 --> 02:09:00,705
I think it's wrong.

3744
02:09:01,395 --> 02:09:03,830
You had it scooped up with the knob behind you, right?

3745
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:04,110
Mm-hmm.

3746
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:04,695
The first time.

3747
02:09:04,755 --> 02:09:04,875
Yep.

3748
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:06,030
Yeah, I think, lemme see.

3749
02:09:07,755 --> 02:09:07,935
Yeah.

3750
02:09:07,935 --> 02:09:09,675
So it's gotta be the exact opposite.

3751
02:09:10,035 --> 02:09:10,710
So scooped up.

3752
02:09:11,525 --> 02:09:12,655
It's a on that side.

3753
02:09:13,125 --> 02:09:13,415
Okay.

3754
02:09:16,215 --> 02:09:17,140
I think it's where the,

3755
02:09:22,115 --> 02:09:22,750
on that side.

3756
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:23,050
Thankfully

3757
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:26,535
leah: my PhD wish we had programs at the.

3758
02:09:30,974 --> 02:09:31,195
Way.

3759
02:09:33,110 --> 02:09:34,280
Can we just turn it this way?

3760
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:34,639
Sure.

3761
02:09:35,150 --> 02:09:37,400
brian: No, because the angle, here's why.

3762
02:09:37,969 --> 02:09:39,860
See the angle, it's 30 degrees.

3763
02:09:40,490 --> 02:09:48,080
If you turn it there, it's 30 degrees that way it's a 60 degree angle difference
and it actually messes us up for getting up parallel and perfectly placed.

3764
02:09:48,349 --> 02:09:49,519
So this is our last chance.

3765
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:04,550
Sure.

3766
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:04,969
Hungry.

3767
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:06,320
Did I eat?

3768
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:06,889
Yeah, I did.

3769
02:10:06,889 --> 02:10:07,760
We thought that last time.

3770
02:10:08,420 --> 02:10:11,540
I even eat too, but I feel like I've been hungry as a rotation.

3771
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,130
I don't know if it's because I'm running around more

3772
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:14,120
leah: can wake all day.

3773
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:16,370
brian: I could be wrong sometimes we're not out.

3774
02:10:17,090 --> 02:10:18,050
I'm excited though.

3775
02:10:18,290 --> 02:10:19,370
Our tomato plans finally.

3776
02:10:19,370 --> 02:10:19,790
How's it looking?

3777
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:19,849
We're

3778
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:21,170
leah: good.

3779
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:21,889
Okay.

3780
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:27,530
brian: So next one we'll be facing that way and really shot.

3781
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:30,019
Really?

3782
02:10:33,019 --> 02:10:33,559
All righty.

3783
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:38,540
Oh, that makes her face Is this, that's our, that's our mnemonic.

3784
02:10:39,590 --> 02:10:39,830
Okay.

3785
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:46,610
leah: Okay.

3786
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:48,405
I think I'm right on top.

3787
02:10:49,394 --> 02:10:50,054
Pushed across.

3788
02:10:50,054 --> 02:10:52,275
I always try to feel like I'm really engaging all the way across.

3789
02:10:53,264 --> 02:10:53,955
That's true.

3790
02:10:54,315 --> 02:10:54,644
Sweet.

3791
02:10:54,644 --> 02:10:55,844
I'll take one more Vore.

3792
02:10:56,415 --> 02:10:56,804
Thank you.

3793
02:10:59,474 --> 02:11:02,594
There's a little bit of schmutz there, so I'm gonna try to like slide it up.

3794
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:04,394
Yeah, we'll see.

3795
02:11:04,394 --> 02:11:04,875
It's here for you.

3796
02:11:05,025 --> 02:11:05,865
leah: Um, oh, sorry.

3797
02:11:06,315 --> 02:11:07,545
And then you mind pushing up a little bit.

3798
02:11:07,545 --> 02:11:09,134
Kad over the Interesting.

3799
02:11:09,764 --> 02:11:10,065
Yeah.

3800
02:11:10,065 --> 02:11:11,295
Can you read, um, it's like twisting.

3801
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:14,174
I, I think you're pushing to the Yeah, exactly.

3802
02:11:14,174 --> 02:11:14,625
That's better.

3803
02:11:14,625 --> 02:11:14,924
That's nice.

3804
02:11:18,825 --> 02:11:20,025
Actually, maybe that made it worse.

3805
02:11:20,714 --> 02:11:23,415
brian: And you can always use a clip player here if you need to.

3806
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:23,891
Okay, sure.

3807
02:11:24,255 --> 02:11:24,495
leah: Okay.

3808
02:11:25,184 --> 02:11:29,565
brian: Because you can not get it all the way around and it's specimen, it doesn't matter.

3809
02:11:29,894 --> 02:11:30,255
leah: Right.

3810
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:41,400
I'm gonna just see my posterior time, which I do not see.

3811
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:42,630
brian: Just use a clip.

3812
02:11:44,580 --> 02:11:44,910
leah: Sorry.

3813
02:11:46,020 --> 02:11:46,050
brian: Okay.

3814
02:11:46,050 --> 02:11:47,130
I was gonna say just use a clip.

3815
02:11:47,130 --> 02:11:47,190
Yeah.

3816
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:50,400
leah: No, I don't like that.

3817
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,300
I don't, you can't feel it

3818
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:53,490
brian: because your duct flow's not very long, you know?

3819
02:11:53,550 --> 02:11:53,850
Yeah.

3820
02:11:53,910 --> 02:11:56,220
If you are able to do it, you're gonna be really close.

3821
02:11:57,090 --> 02:12:00,450
I'd rather have more duct in a shitty specimen closure, I think.

3822
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:01,260
leah: Okay.

3823
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:04,140
brian: Or you could skeletonize more, but that's not a good use of time.

3824
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:07,500
So just take a clip of fire, fire above where you are right now.

3825
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:09,060
leah: So fire this higher.

3826
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:10,350
brian: A clip of fire.

3827
02:12:10,350 --> 02:12:10,650
Higher.

3828
02:12:10,655 --> 02:12:10,865
Yeah.

3829
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:12,930
Follow me?

3830
02:12:13,170 --> 02:12:13,470
leah: No.

3831
02:12:13,585 --> 02:12:13,875
brian: Okay.

3832
02:12:14,835 --> 02:12:16,470
So take this out and, oh, okay.

3833
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:16,471
Okay.

3834
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:18,540
brian: Thank you.

3835
02:12:19,530 --> 02:12:21,390
I was like, he's like, how does she not get this?

3836
02:12:21,390 --> 02:12:22,260
I don't know how to say it.

3837
02:12:22,260 --> 02:12:24,175
This, she's can't slow, can.

3838
02:12:24,835 --> 02:12:25,375
No, no, no.

3839
02:12:25,475 --> 02:12:27,390
Kat, I would not communicating clearly.

3840
02:12:27,540 --> 02:12:28,320
I'll slide up though.

3841
02:12:28,770 --> 02:12:29,700
Don't get all the way across.

3842
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:30,180
It doesn't matter.

3843
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:30,570
Slide up.

3844
02:12:30,570 --> 02:12:31,260
Give yourself room.

3845
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:33,000
Okay.

3846
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:33,630
brian: Keep going.

3847
02:12:33,930 --> 02:12:34,680
Slide, slide, slide.

3848
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:35,100
There you go.

3849
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:35,850
Now flip it.

3850
02:12:38,790 --> 02:12:38,940
Okay.

3851
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:39,690
Good enough.

3852
02:12:40,830 --> 02:12:42,300
leah: Ah, okay.

3853
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:42,360
Okay.

3854
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:44,550
We come back.

3855
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:45,180
You can just a hair.

3856
02:12:45,420 --> 02:12:46,320
Yeah, you're good.

3857
02:12:47,370 --> 02:12:47,610
Scissors.

3858
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:48,180
leah: Thank you.

3859
02:12:50,130 --> 02:12:51,300
And I'll give us a lot of length.

3860
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:51,750
Cut up high.

3861
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:52,080
Exactly.

3862
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:52,740
Yeah.

3863
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:52,980
I just don't

3864
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:54,660
brian: wanna have any slippage.

3865
02:12:54,930 --> 02:12:56,165
leah: All right, let's pop on in there.

3866
02:12:56,625 --> 02:12:58,365
brian: Oh, these hemo locks are really good.

3867
02:13:18,345 --> 02:13:20,310
No, no stone's in there.

3868
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:21,810
Shit.

3869
02:13:21,930 --> 02:13:22,140
No.

3870
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:23,340
I saw you milked earlier.

3871
02:13:23,490 --> 02:13:25,350
Yeah, but I'm sad to see.

3872
02:13:25,555 --> 02:13:26,190
leah: Okay, good.

3873
02:13:26,190 --> 02:13:27,060
This still come across?

3874
02:13:28,275 --> 02:13:29,245
brian: Yeah, we're gonna need it.

3875
02:13:29,345 --> 02:13:30,720
Can you get suction up for us please?

3876
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:30,960
Okay.

3877
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:31,500
Absolutely

3878
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:32,850
leah: rats.

3879
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:33,900
Yeah, I milked it too.

3880
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:34,565
I know you did.

3881
02:13:34,565 --> 02:13:35,245
Yeah, I saw.

3882
02:13:36,115 --> 02:13:36,405
brian: Yeah.

3883
02:13:36,405 --> 02:13:36,605
Yeah.

3884
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:37,830
I mean, while you were palpating, you were milking.

3885
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:39,060
leah: Yeah,

3886
02:13:39,955 --> 02:13:40,485
brian: it's all good.

3887
02:13:40,830 --> 02:13:43,290
leah: It didn't feel super stony to be totally honest.

3888
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:44,925
brian: I don't know that we need irrigation, actually.

3889
02:13:44,955 --> 02:13:45,645
Just inception.

3890
02:13:46,595 --> 02:13:46,885
Okay.

3891
02:13:46,885 --> 02:13:47,490
Yeah, we need that.

3892
02:13:47,490 --> 02:13:49,680
Yeah, but we maybe, well, I'll just leave

3893
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:51,000
it, sit there for just a few off.

3894
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:54,525
brian: I mean, you know, sir, we never change her mind.

3895
02:13:54,575 --> 02:13:54,925
Right?

3896
02:13:54,925 --> 02:13:55,165
Come.

3897
02:13:56,755 --> 02:13:58,110
leah: Hope she doesn't have a drop stone.

3898
02:13:58,530 --> 02:13:58,860
What?

3899
02:13:58,860 --> 02:13:59,790
Hope she doesn't have a dropped.

3900
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:02,370
brian: We also never lie about time because she has the,

3901
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:04,410
leah: she already has the stricture.

3902
02:14:04,410 --> 02:14:14,100
Yesterday, I think I said maybe she should get an ERCP after Ask Dr. George or some, Hey,
Dr. George, since she has a stricture already, we don't know if she has a drop stone.

3903
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:18,570
Should we just keep her and like get LFTs and, or would you just let her go home and She's got a stent?

3904
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:21,240
She does have a stent for her to obstruct.

3905
02:14:21,330 --> 02:14:22,080
She still has.

3906
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:22,440
Okay.

3907
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:23,280
Okay.

3908
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:26,940
So because her, her stent has, has occluded once.

3909
02:14:28,145 --> 02:14:29,750
brian: So, I mean, I don't how long.

3910
02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:30,030
Okay.

3911
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:30,830
No, I wouldn't keep it.

3912
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:31,685
leah: Do you want me to try to,

3913
02:14:32,345 --> 02:14:36,185
brian: uh, suck up the stone if you Oh, do you have a 10 milliliter, um, uh, suction tip catheter.

3914
02:14:37,295 --> 02:14:37,535
Gotcha.

3915
02:14:37,535 --> 02:14:38,465
We don't have a big one.

3916
02:14:38,465 --> 02:14:39,155
I can go get one.

3917
02:14:39,155 --> 02:14:39,395
Oh, it's

3918
02:14:39,395 --> 02:14:40,145
brian: not in the set?

3919
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:40,510
No.

3920
02:14:41,645 --> 02:14:42,005
brian: Let's see.

3921
02:14:42,005 --> 02:14:42,995
We'll see if this sucks it up.

3922
02:14:42,995 --> 02:14:43,265
It might.

3923
02:14:43,595 --> 02:14:44,885
How about I wander that way?

3924
02:14:44,915 --> 02:14:45,365
So that sounds

3925
02:14:45,365 --> 02:14:46,085
brian: like a great idea.

3926
02:14:50,735 --> 02:14:50,885
Okay.

3927
02:14:50,885 --> 02:14:53,180
Your suction is on it.

3928
02:14:54,365 --> 02:14:54,725
Go get that.

3929
02:14:54,725 --> 02:14:55,175
Thanks.

3930
02:14:56,675 --> 02:14:56,855
leah: All right.

3931
02:14:56,855 --> 02:14:57,815
I got that little guy out.

3932
02:14:57,815 --> 02:14:58,355
It's pretty good.

3933
02:14:58,415 --> 02:14:58,685
All right.

3934
02:14:58,685 --> 02:14:59,075
Good job.

3935
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:01,235
brian: Because I was just avoiding drop stone.

3936
02:15:01,445 --> 02:15:03,095
Yeah, I I've done that one too.

3937
02:15:03,305 --> 02:15:04,325
Had to reoperate on someone.

3938
02:15:04,445 --> 02:15:05,015
A year later.

3939
02:15:05,285 --> 02:15:06,005
leah: A year later.

3940
02:15:06,005 --> 02:15:06,515
Gracious.

3941
02:15:06,545 --> 02:15:08,255
brian: Well, yeah, 'cause it had an un resolving abscess.

3942
02:15:08,370 --> 02:15:08,450
Yeah.

3943
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:11,290
And I finally just, just like dug it out.

3944
02:15:11,915 --> 02:15:14,225
It was really ugly.

3945
02:15:20,105 --> 02:15:21,245
leah: I could probably bo be that, but

3946
02:15:22,025 --> 02:15:22,176
brian: That's great.

3947
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:22,630
Good job.

3948
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:30,040
leah: Thank you.

3949
02:15:43,710 --> 02:15:44,714
This is really nice.

3950
02:15:45,014 --> 02:15:45,495
leah: Nice.

3951
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:46,559
This is really nice.

3952
02:15:48,915 --> 02:15:53,054
I feel like when it comes off the too nicely, it's like oddly satisfying, you know?

3953
02:15:54,344 --> 02:15:54,674
Oh yeah.

3954
02:15:55,155 --> 02:15:55,335
brian: Edge mean

3955
02:15:55,605 --> 02:15:56,179
like when you're coming.

3956
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:56,620
Fsa.

3957
02:15:56,839 --> 02:15:58,219
The fsa, I meant, sorry.

3958
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:01,299
It just very, like, when it just comes right off and it just, and like,

3959
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:04,769
brian: come

3960
02:16:04,769 --> 02:16:04,969
in

3961
02:16:07,809 --> 02:16:07,929
Cauter

3962
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:16,809
brian: down here.

3963
02:16:20,419 --> 02:16:20,889
leah: Thank you.

3964
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:23,250
Okay.

3965
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:23,650
Come up.

3966
02:16:28,754 --> 02:16:29,504
brian: That grabs not good.

3967
02:16:29,504 --> 02:16:29,684
Right?

3968
02:16:30,105 --> 02:16:31,004
See, I don't have enough tension.

3969
02:16:31,004 --> 02:16:31,125
I come.

3970
02:16:31,125 --> 02:16:31,455
Yeah.

3971
02:16:31,544 --> 02:16:33,734
Could you come underneath so I can do as much as I possibly can?

3972
02:16:33,945 --> 02:16:34,184
leah: Yep.

3973
02:16:35,264 --> 02:16:38,594
brian: While I have what I have, but I'm gonna run out a minute here very quickly.

3974
02:16:40,365 --> 02:16:41,895
It's awkward, it's slow.

3975
02:16:41,955 --> 02:16:42,254
Yeah.

3976
02:16:42,375 --> 02:16:46,154
Speaking velocity and I'm just like back.

3977
02:16:46,154 --> 02:16:46,545
Good job.

3978
02:16:46,635 --> 02:16:49,754
Every time I move, you want to avoid me, like, be afraid because I'm gonna, you,

3979
02:16:50,984 --> 02:16:51,824
leah: you're doing great, Dagan.

3980
02:16:58,580 --> 02:16:59,074
I don't think it's

3981
02:17:01,654 --> 02:17:02,134
brian: so nice.

3982
02:17:02,134 --> 02:17:03,724
This is a good, so the move, yeah.

3983
02:17:03,875 --> 02:17:07,594
Heel up grab under wide.

3984
02:17:08,764 --> 02:17:09,125
Okay.

3985
02:17:09,125 --> 02:17:09,244
Lift

3986
02:17:09,244 --> 02:17:09,455
leah: that

3987
02:17:09,455 --> 02:17:09,754
brian: puppy

3988
02:17:09,754 --> 02:17:09,934
leah: up

3989
02:17:10,414 --> 02:17:11,134
brian: in that angle.

3990
02:17:11,134 --> 02:17:12,244
That's not a very good grab.

3991
02:17:12,334 --> 02:17:22,564
And then I turn my thing on parallel, but it's not quite, not like that, but like that, not
like that, but like that so that the heel's sliding off and I barely touch my instrument.

3992
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:24,490
Okay.

3993
02:17:27,655 --> 02:17:28,855
Too far over as part of it.

3994
02:17:29,125 --> 02:17:30,805
Oh, nice, nice.

3995
02:17:30,805 --> 02:17:32,485
That's not a great grab I take anyway.

3996
02:17:34,254 --> 02:17:34,285
brian: Okay.

3997
02:17:34,285 --> 02:17:37,915
Anyways, that's how you keep your hook and get it out without perforating the gall

3998
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:42,120
training.

3999
02:17:44,455 --> 02:17:45,295
Great tension over there.

4000
02:17:45,295 --> 02:17:45,985
Can't really

4001
02:17:45,985 --> 02:17:47,005
brian: see good.

4002
02:17:47,005 --> 02:17:47,725
Oh, there's some good tension.

4003
02:17:47,725 --> 02:17:47,934
Yeah.

4004
02:17:48,235 --> 02:17:48,535
Nice.

4005
02:17:48,535 --> 02:17:49,645
Come across.

4006
02:17:50,215 --> 02:17:51,205
That's yellow there.

4007
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:51,610
That means it'd,

4008
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:04,830
it's kind of a weird angle.

4009
02:18:05,059 --> 02:18:10,030
Usually on that side more, but I can't get there very easily, so I'm just avoiding it.

4010
02:18:15,625 --> 02:18:16,315
Tension there.

4011
02:18:17,005 --> 02:18:18,684
I have tension there, but I'm gonna release it.

4012
02:18:18,805 --> 02:18:24,835
Come in so I can cook this and it doesn't come apart anyway, so not my idea.

4013
02:18:25,915 --> 02:18:28,100
Now there's a vessel there, so I'm gonna cook right there.

4014
02:18:29,090 --> 02:18:30,140
It's gonna pull harder

4015
02:18:32,970 --> 02:18:33,260
here

4016
02:18:38,870 --> 02:18:39,220
still.

4017
02:18:39,595 --> 02:18:40,465
brian: Great tension there.

4018
02:18:40,765 --> 02:18:41,215
Okay, come back.

4019
02:18:43,885 --> 02:18:44,665
Your left hand.

4020
02:18:44,965 --> 02:18:45,415
Can you?

4021
02:18:45,535 --> 02:18:50,905
That's the problem actually, I didn't realize your left hand is pulling too far to the patient's left.

4022
02:18:51,775 --> 02:18:52,255
There you go.

4023
02:18:52,705 --> 02:18:53,485
That'll help me a lot.

4024
02:18:53,845 --> 02:18:54,115
Thank you.

4025
02:18:55,045 --> 02:18:55,855
Come in the camera.

4026
02:18:56,035 --> 02:18:56,184
Can you.

4027
02:19:03,549 --> 02:19:03,840
Okay.

4028
02:19:05,349 --> 02:19:05,980
There we go.

4029
02:19:08,529 --> 02:19:09,019
Come in.

4030
02:19:13,449 --> 02:19:14,139
leah: Good tension there.

4031
02:19:21,379 --> 02:19:27,500
brian: I don't like cooking just happened, so I did not have enough tension in my plane.

4032
02:19:27,809 --> 02:19:28,820
There's quite here.

4033
02:19:29,170 --> 02:19:30,906
Flip there Some planes there.

4034
02:19:37,234 --> 02:19:39,379
leah: Could cat regrab to help you or no?

4035
02:19:39,514 --> 02:19:39,814
No.

4036
02:19:39,965 --> 02:19:40,174
Okay.

4037
02:19:40,174 --> 02:19:40,924
brian: I don't think so.

4038
02:19:40,930 --> 02:19:42,965
It's just, I mean, yes, but it's not worth the time.

4039
02:19:43,084 --> 02:19:43,295
Okay.

4040
02:19:44,525 --> 02:19:44,945
I'll adjust.

4041
02:19:47,285 --> 02:19:50,525
She'll eventually pull towards her over the right patient's.

4042
02:19:50,525 --> 02:19:50,705
Right.

4043
02:19:50,705 --> 02:19:52,744
Even more right now.

4044
02:19:53,465 --> 02:19:54,005
Patient's, right?

4045
02:19:54,335 --> 02:19:54,455
Yep.

4046
02:19:55,055 --> 02:19:55,625
Patient's right.

4047
02:19:55,744 --> 02:19:55,865
Good.

4048
02:19:55,865 --> 02:19:56,224
Thanks.

4049
02:19:56,585 --> 02:19:57,125
Stop there.

4050
02:19:57,785 --> 02:19:58,265
leah: Oh, nice.

4051
02:19:58,265 --> 02:19:58,445
Yeah.

4052
02:20:02,315 --> 02:20:02,585
brian: How's that?

4053
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:06,170
Oh, you're pulling to our just a cap too.

4054
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:11,170
It's not your fault.

4055
02:20:11,170 --> 02:20:11,770
Yeah, it's

4056
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:28,370
okay.

4057
02:20:28,690 --> 02:20:30,090
I understand My planes right now.

4058
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:32,630
Okay.

4059
02:20:32,630 --> 02:20:33,430
I gotta grab closer.

4060
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,710
Every time I fail, I grab closer

4061
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:39,270
brian: out.

4062
02:20:39,290 --> 02:20:39,510
Out.

4063
02:20:39,650 --> 02:20:40,865
See, I can't get a good grab.

4064
02:20:41,075 --> 02:20:42,125
Why can't I get a good grab?

4065
02:20:42,125 --> 02:20:44,885
I wanna go underneath, but it's not really working.

4066
02:20:46,565 --> 02:20:48,785
Why not Kat come towards you a little bit more and lower?

4067
02:20:48,785 --> 02:20:49,895
Don't put a lot of tension on it.

4068
02:20:49,925 --> 02:20:50,615
Just rotate.

4069
02:20:51,035 --> 02:20:51,275
Okay.

4070
02:20:51,815 --> 02:20:51,905
Nice.

4071
02:20:51,905 --> 02:20:52,325
That's great.

4072
02:20:52,325 --> 02:20:52,535
Yeah.

4073
02:20:52,655 --> 02:20:53,915
Thanks.

4074
02:20:53,915 --> 02:20:53,916
Nice.

4075
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:57,650
Let's try this effort.

4076
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:00,170
Come on in through the haze.

4077
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:03,170
brian: It's

4078
02:21:03,170 --> 02:21:03,730
on the run here.

4079
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:03,970
Oh

brian: Pull straight up.

4082
02:21:09,390 --> 02:21:09,610
Now

4083
02:21:48,310 --> 02:21:51,515
you guys could all this, it would just take a little, it would take us a little.

4084
02:21:52,055 --> 02:21:52,415
leah: No problem.

4085
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:55,670
Okay,

4086
02:22:00,609 --> 02:22:00,900

leah: Sorry.

4094
02:22:20,529 --> 02:22:21,045
brian: Done, please.

4095
02:22:26,609 --> 02:22:26,900
Nice.

4096
02:22:28,005 --> 02:22:30,550
leah: Sometimes the jaws get locked on that tissue, so you have to turn that

4097
02:22:31,574 --> 02:22:31,994
brian: up and shake

4098
02:22:31,994 --> 02:22:31,997
leah: it up.

4099
02:22:31,997 --> 02:22:32,109
Shake it,

4100
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:33,150
brian: hook them all the way.

4101
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:33,510
Shake.

4102
02:22:35,085 --> 02:22:35,385
leah: Nice.

4103
02:22:35,385 --> 02:22:35,685
Good job.

just for a sec.

4107
02:22:57,285 --> 02:22:58,125
Maybe vent again.

4108
02:23:01,125 --> 02:23:01,814
Maybe vent again.

4109
02:23:02,144 --> 02:23:02,295
What?

4110
02:23:02,595 --> 02:23:03,164
Vent again?

4111
02:23:04,724 --> 02:23:05,414
brian: We were getting low.

4112
02:23:05,414 --> 02:23:05,990
Keep vent again?

4113
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,189
Yeah.

4114
02:23:06,189 --> 02:23:06,630
Forever.

4115
02:23:07,289 --> 02:23:07,710
leah: Oh, forever.

4116
02:23:19,305 --> 02:23:19,545
brian: Come in.

4117
02:23:29,355 --> 02:23:34,820
So you didn't spill any bm, so I won't, I won't irrigate rather just little bit.

4118
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:51,850
leah: Okay.

4119
02:23:53,565 --> 02:23:54,315
Look at that duct.

4120
02:23:55,035 --> 02:23:55,695
Nice

4121
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:58,370

4122
02:24:00,105 --> 02:24:01,215
leah: Great clips look great static.

4123

02:24:12,590 --> 02:24:12,880
brian: Okay.

4125
02:24:14,185 --> 02:24:15,150
Put that over there.

4126

Color, please.

4127
02:24:27,449 --> 02:24:27,869
Mm-hmm.

4128
02:24:47,035 --> 02:24:47,935
leah: Do you have a Ray Tech?

4129
02:24:48,865 --> 02:24:49,074
brian: Huh?

4130
02:24:50,305 --> 02:24:51,699
leah: Oh, I was asking for Ray Tech.

4131
02:24:52,310 --> 02:24:52,820
Thank you.

4132
02:24:55,170 --> 02:24:55,410
brian: Specimen?

4133
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:55,769
Mm-hmm.

4134
02:24:57,385 --> 02:24:58,404

4135
02:25:03,715 --> 02:25:04,525
leah: You grab a hunter.

4136
02:25:04,555 --> 02:25:04,585
Okay.

4137
02:25:10,315 --> 02:25:11,950
brian: I usually use, oh my bad.

4138
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:12,445
It's okay.

4139
02:25:13,015 --> 02:25:13,345
Grab it.

4140
02:25:14,335 --> 02:25:15,355
leah: Oh, you did tell me that yesterday.

4141
02:25:16,645 --> 02:25:18,055
brian: More degrees of freedom because of the angle.

4142
02:25:18,625 --> 02:25:20,035
Okay, gotcha.

4143
02:25:20,215 --> 02:25:22,705
Turn your, your instrument so you can see both times next time.

4144
02:25:24,135 --> 02:25:25,025
Make it easier on you.

4145
02:25:25,255 --> 02:25:25,545
Okay.

4146
02:25:26,840 --> 02:25:27,350
Ready for your,

4148
02:25:36,050 --> 02:25:38,150
leah: Have a gall bladder for permanent snap on this side.

4149
02:25:38,750 --> 02:25:39,500
You have Snap please.

4150
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:40,851
Snap right on this one.

4151
02:25:44,090 --> 02:25:44,510
No, you're good.

4152
02:25:46,310 --> 02:25:47,540
And then do you have that Maryland?

4153
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:48,500
Yeah.

4154
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:51,790
Just in case

4155
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:54,370
she's keeping it.

4156
02:25:55,885 --> 02:25:57,215
brian: It's bloody strange.

4157
02:25:57,790 --> 02:25:58,480
Bloody, bloody

4158
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:05,020
nice.

4159
02:26:07,245 --> 02:26:09,575
Sure did better.

4160
02:26:16,810 --> 02:26:18,040
leah: Just make sure he gets the right end.

4161
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:18,430
Yeah.

4162
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:19,420
Nice.

4163
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:21,580
brian: There's a needle.

4164
02:26:21,580 --> 02:26:21,670
Mm-hmm.

4165
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:22,810
leah: No, let's just have blood there.

4166
02:26:24,850 --> 02:26:25,900
brian: Sorry to come at you with that.

4167
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:26,800
Little aggressively.

02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:28,300
Okay.

4169
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:34,690
We don't tie it up yet because it's insulated, but I wanna make sure that we at least are sealed.

4170
02:26:35,650 --> 02:26:36,940
Adequate for reuse.

4171
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:37,060
Right?

4172
02:26:37,690 --> 02:26:38,620
Feels fine.

4173
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,480
Maybe I'll stop the bleeding too.

4174
02:26:41,230 --> 02:26:42,610
Okay, let's take out these ports.

4175
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:44,200

Good job.

4179
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:50,050
brian: This one, we go back and forth between the two.

4180
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:52,540

4183
02:27:08,830 --> 02:27:09,790
leah: and then just leave that in there.

4184
02:27:09,790 --> 02:27:11,200
