22:09,"Lift the gallbladder wall to create a knuckle and approach across, not into, the tissue. Keep instrument angled upward to avoid perforation; adjust port angle based on gallbladder height and anatomy."
22:58,Placing the port too low flattens the approach and worsens control; position the port higher for a better upward angle.
25:04,Lower arm when handling the tool.
27:32,Lift gallbladder up.
27:51,Avoid grabbing fat.
27:57,Avoid putting instrument tips into the middle of the gallbladder.
29:19,Gentle sweep to clean fat.
30:48,"When lifting the gallbladder, grasp close to the dissection plane; pulling from too far away tears fatty tissue, causing bleeding and poor visibility."
31:49,"Take a small, accurate grasp on the true edge of the plane ('lip'), not surrounding fat; use both hands to apply opposing tension."
32:35,Hook then pull to left to dissect.
35:38,Regrab the fat to create a better angle.
35:52,Grab closer to the target.
36:41,Fan the fat laterally for a better view of the hole.
37:00,The shape and color of gallbladder show chronic inflammation.
38:39,Grab closer.
39:03,The lip is fat and can be grabbed.
39:16,How to coordinate two hands.
40:37,Rotate camera so that instruments are not blocking the view.
41:25,Lifting the gallbladder too hard collapses the plane; ease off tension so tissue unfolds naturally.
41:42,"If you can't see a structure clearly, stop dissecting. Three options: adjust camera/retraction, push other structures away, or move the tissue."
44:13,Leah suggests the next step.
44:35,Leah pointed out the left hand is not doing well.
44:45,Open the graspers more to grab more gallbladder.
45:08,"Open grasper more, push in, grab, and lift to create better view."
47:00,"A stable, slightly oblique camera angle gives better 3D cues. Avoid steep downward views that distort relationships in Calot's triangle. Camera and instrument angles should complement each other."
47:49,Move away liver for better view.
48:00,Analyzing the anatomy.
48:23,Grab the gallbladder and look at what is behind.
48:30,"The surgeon can't fully see the anatomy, so they reason where it should be and start with a shallow, safe incision in the visible area to expose the plane gradually."
48:49,Senior surgeons discuss which plane to start dissecting.
49:20,Two options for dissection: thinning or layer by layer.
51:10,Actions.
51:22,Hook cautery technique: gentle sweeping to separate tissue and skeletonize duct or artery.
52:19,Slow down and read anatomy carefully. Dissect along visible gallbladder edge in known safe zone.
53:01,What looks like a nerve is likely connective tissue. Stay shallow and dissect along peritoneum.
53:24,Need to angle the tool up.
53:49,Push in to make dissection.
53:58,Sweep to rip.
56:12,Push gently to open plane and continue freeing tissue toward target base.
56:35,Anatomy recognition: beyond it lies liver.
57:54,Push in.
58:15,Push in then turn.
59:51,Hook near gallbladder-liver interface can catch wrong structure; stay in correct plane.
01:00:17,Use camera to visualize how left-hand instrument shapes field; pulling creates dissection space.
01:00:39,Regrab at lower place.
01:00:54,Recognizing artery.
01:01:13,Recognize when left-hand tool obstructs view or movement; adjust to avoid stressing liver.
01:01:44,Hook heel.
01:01:55,"No dig, stay on surface."
01:02:45,Coordinate between two hands.
01:03:19,"When tissue is translucent and converges like a faucet, it’s a safe zone—sweep to expose base."
01:04:51,"Too deep now, don’t go up."
01:05:11,"If dissecting near vessel, don't cross halfway or pull too hard while cauterizing."
01:06:22,Avoid energy activation while touching gallbladder; avoid excessive traction to let small vessels coagulate.
01:06:33,Gentle sweeping.
01:07:34,Recognize a true dissection plane.
01:08:57,Keep dissecting with Marilyn.
01:09:13,Spread tension to avoid bleeding.
01:09:27,Take peritoneal tissue off.
01:10:39,"When peritoneum is tented by a band, an artery lies beneath; peel gently to expose safely."
01:11:43,Grab fat to skeletonize the ductal structures.
01:12:19,Use the 'roll' grasping technique.
01:17:07,Touch the structure to figure out what it is.
01:17:55,Safe exploration and spatial judgment.
01:18:37,The white tissue is the safe spot for dissection.
01:18:59,Touch and confirm nothing is there; continue pushing the dissector to make the dissection.
01:19:58,Push harder.
01:21:42,Big sweep at the clip site.
01:22:09,Fat down; duct coming into view.
01:22:19,Next move: keep cleaning fat.
01:22:37,Resident dissected at the wrong place.
01:22:57,Get more tissue and be more aggressive.
01:23:50,Risk in proceeding because the structure is not clear.
01:24:41,Duct shape is clear; clean the surrounding fat.
01:24:47,Dissection based on recognizing the artery—keep that in mind.
01:25:33,Switch to skeletonize the artery.
01:25:56,Rotate tool slightly downward so both jaws/tips contact tissue for friction and effective dissection.
01:26:39,Bleeding noted; cause uncertain.
01:27:03,Anatomy is confusing—recognizing base vs. gallbladder.
01:27:32,Dissect at a higher position.
01:28:41,Brian suggests going up.
01:30:11,Brian suggests skeletonizing the duct next.
01:32:16,Two holes in the fat; start with the upper one.
01:32:51,"Sequence: push in, rotate, sweep."
01:33:21,Be careful—there might be something in the fat.
01:33:31,They decide there is nothing in the fat.
01:35:20,Predict hepatic arteries are behind.
01:35:39,Ask Leah to take off the node.
01:35:52,Artery is done.
01:38:14,"The node was vascular, causing bleeding."
01:38:58,Spread on both sides of the cystic artery with Maryland; fully expose its length to confirm you're not at the base.
01:41:43,Keep instrument perpendicular to vessel/duct axis; rotate or curl to match orientation.
01:43:35,Adjust left hand.
01:45:30,See the next dissection goal.
01:45:56,Recognize hidden artery.
01:48:44,Make an anatomy guess.
01:49:40,Might be bleeding based on experience.
01:50:39,Unknown band appears; work below it.
01:51:21,Ripping may cause bleeding.
01:51:51,"If structure unknown, pull with tool to check."
01:52:38,"For unknown structures, grab gently."
01:54:47,Anatomy is confusing—nothing or vessel?
01:55:12,Clean fat around the unknown structure first.
01:55:44,Structure now feels pulsing.
01:58:29,Hands are too high.
01:58:58,Brian takes over; starts with easier structures.
02:01:27,"After dissecting the back of the gallbladder, unknown structure seen connected to gallbladder."
02:02:31,Slide down clips when applying.
02:02:49,Move clips up and visualize clip tips.
02:08:21,"If a clip is misoriented, remove and reload it."
02:09:35,"A 30° instrument rotation changes the approach angle by ~60°, misaligning the clip."
02:11:51,"When the cystic duct is short, avoid dissecting too much to lengthen it; instead, clip slightly higher for a secure seal."
02:17:10,"Keep tool parallel, let heel glide off tissue, and use minimal pressure for precise, safe dissection."
02:18:15,"Surgeon releases traction before applying energy to avoid tearing; cauterizes small vessel carefully, anticipating tension change to maintain control."
02:26:24,Checks that the sealed stump is secure and dry before removing ports.
02:26:48,Checks for bleeding by moving the camera back and forth.
02:26:56,Withdraws scope to inspect each port site; instruments removed in sequence.
