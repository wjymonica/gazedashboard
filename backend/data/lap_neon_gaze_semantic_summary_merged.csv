We'll take gas on please. Yes. Low. Okay. Opening pressure six. Perfect. We can go. Well, we're already on high flow. We can get high flow or three. I mean, even though the vari doesn't do anything limited by our instrument, we are insufflating. Okay. Let's white balance our little guy. Wait, what'd you say? Oh, it's in the white balance Fail. Usually you can white balance. Are you where all the monitors are? Yeah. Yeah, because I've got one right there. Leah. Is our light on? So our camera on? Is it on? Nope. Nope. Can we get the, um, the light on looking at you? I think right here you see where you can turn the light on. Go down. I see. And click your first one. Oh. There isn't it? Beautiful Turn back. You can do that too."

27,"00:17:30,440","00:18:33,240",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss adjusting the camera or view for better visualization.,"Okay, now, right now let's switch our camera here to the ambo port, and then we'll do our epigastric port. That'll be our big one. Yep. What do we have? We have an 11 or 12. Do you wanna go to the, and we're gonna go like, um, so I think that's to the right of the, our policy. Yeah. I usually try to Google kind of through it. And I feel like for this you can never be like, I mean you can, but you can never really be too high. So I just think a little bit higher than you expect and then come through and then angle through FCI towards gallbladder, but kind of like coming. Can I see the other side of fie real quick? Just because I know. Dr. George when we went in last time too, you said it kind of angled almost come like a gray. Yeah, exactly. Crot like, like the, almost like the crotch over the fsy hangs down. So I'll take a, um, find your needle real quick. I feel like she's like catty head, so I think you're a little too low. Okay. Yeah. So you wanna come up higher? Okay. But you wanna come through here and then angle through that side. Okay. Yeah."
28,"00:18:46,145","00:20:20,890",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They confirm that the current action or position looks correct.,"You might not be able to see it. You might be going through FAU can remember, but I think you're going mark to the skin. Remember, so you have landmarks for yourself. Okay. It's easier. I'm too lateral. It's just a, A small pearl. Yeah, just wherever you mark it, it's okay. But draw some landmarks for yourself. This is xiphoid right here. You wanting to be just a little bit up here and then almost like, so I actually don't think that's xiphoid, that's why I think you're off midline. Xiphos here. Yeah, OIDs here. We still want to go like medial to fallacy or Yeah. I would go like, you could go like right here and then when you put your port in, you'll come down and then you'll angle through fallacy that way. Okay. Draw a big line, three hash marks on it. Remember? Yep. That'll be fine. Yep. And then you use that as a reference when you're doing your needle there. You'll know where you're at when make a decision. Okay. Something I'm like, it's weird 'cause I, there you're, yeah, this is kind of actually where I wanted to come out. Like right there. Yeah. Right on that side of f."
29,"00:20:37,075","00:23:06,150",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss manipulating or exposing the gallbladder and surrounding tissue.,"In what size is this port again? This is gonna be, we're first gonna put in a five then no or no? 11. 11. Just, yeah. I was just asking. 11 or 12. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. No, you're good. I was asking Fine. We should talk about skin incisions at some point. Okay. That massive hemorrhage is avoidable. Okay. Remind problem and then, yeah, just watch. So you don't Skype too much. I usually try to come and, and then turn angle. Every angle you actually have a finder needle angle. Remember Exactly with angle. That wasn't the angle. It was that way. Yep. And it was slightly all elevated up. Yep. That was your angle. Go from the finer needle. If you do that, you'll come up where you want it's noise. Perfect. Back and then we'll switch the gas to here. Alright, let's see. Gallbladder. There she is. Okay. All right. Let's do our lateral track support. This is one I, um, think a lot about. Okay, Dr. George. So I just wanna double check that I don't put this in the wrong spot. So you'll look a little more, um, inferior. Yep. Which one do you think lot about? Um, I'm thinking about my lateral and my second, my hand part. Yeah. That second board's really critical. 'cause the operator, if it's too far away, their shoulder's painful. There's a lot of considerations. Is that an okay spot for the lateral cord? Yeah. We haven't done one of these before. Huh? This probably shouldn't. Not a while. One with you first. Nonetheless. Physically annoying, so, yeah. Yeah. So, uh, to you, I mean, not to me. Sorry. Oh, well it would probably not me too. So, uh, what I'd like to do is grab the gallbladder and, and so you take gallbladder and you have a knuckle of it and you'll go across, so your angle of that port needs to be so up. 'cause if your down too much, your, your ends are gonna be in the middle of the gallbladder. This, this is a gallbladder. Mm-hmm. If the ends are in there and then you push up it perforates there. Okay. So you want it all the way across, which means it needs to be down low enough to do that. Okay. So entirely depends on the anatomy of how tall the gallbladder is. That looks like once you elevate, you'll be in an angle that's going up. Mm-hmm. And there looks fine. If you need more room, you can go side, go upside down. Right. Would you go more down on the patient body wall? So it's more inferior go the more you lose your angle actually. Okay. Alright. So it's actually fine to be somewhat higher. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll take the needle please."

34,"00:23:58,014","00:24:01,370",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They confirm that the current action or position looks correct.,All right. We'll see if that's okay. All right. Okay.
35,"00:24:02,030","00:24:12,440",3 Information management,3 Information management,They discuss placing or confirming clips on the cystic structures.,"Um, now we gotta do our other left hand port. Okay. You have another, um, no, we can take, we can just use this one and I can just towel, we'll do a towel clip. Okay."
36,"00:24:15,500","00:24:19,280",1 Instruction,1.1 Assessment,They confirm that the current action or position looks correct.,"Okay. So, Dr. George for this, um, left hand operating port,"
37,"00:24:25,370","00:24:28,190",1 Instruction,1.4 Point to errors / task,They point out a possible issue or give a corrective instruction.,my thought would be about here. So it's not in the way.
38,"00:24:30,560","00:24:30,950",1 Instruction,1.1 Assessment,They discuss procedural details or coordination during the operation.,So
39,"00:24:32,810","00:28:27,754",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss adjusting the camera or view for better visualization.,"it's relatively in line. It's not blocking the camera. The better is 'cause you can kind of move things around without hitting camera and hitting your other instrument. Right. Okay. But the farther away you are, the worse it is on your left shoulder. Right. Because it's farther away from your axis. Okay. Um, so I actually will do one, one hand away from that one. Right? That's little. Yeah. So I would actually bias a little more. You're gonna find it's gonna be quite painful to your arm, otherwise, okay. The up and down piece is relevant also for your shoulder. The higher you are, the more triangulation spread there is. The more your arm's up like that, right? The lower you are, the more you're relaxed and have it where you want it. Okay. So it's all trade offs. There's no right answer in this, but don't, that seems like a reasonable experiment and then you're gonna feel how it feels to you. Okay? Okay. Could make it painful. Yeah, it might be, but I, that looks reasonable to me. Okay. You know, it's a little, little more I than I would go. But you're young. So, and strong. Am I strong? I hope so. She's young and strong. I don't know if you're strong. Yeah, me neither. Big and strong. He's the youngest and strongest. I may the weakest link on the team. I probably, I was gonna say you're older too with like, are you older? Are you nontraditional student research for a few years and then got a master's. I was, alright, we're gonna move the gas. You went straight? No, I did a two year fellowship up in Boston. Where? Uh, research fellowship In Boston. Research book? Yeah. Is that in Boston? As in like Harvard? Uh, I was in Boston. I was like through the Brigham. Oh, fancy. You can always tell someone from Harvard. That's not me. I didn't tell them much. Hello? That's not me. I was just, I'm joking. Yeah. I thought Good. Say again. I thought it was a good job. It's not that good. Okay. Speed. All right. Ports are in. Okay. It's this, uh, prestige. Prestige. Perfect. Thanks. You mind coming in, Kat? So there's, there's a, a weird technique that maybe do, once you get exposure, I'll, I'll show you how it do you, we a little head up. We do know what we did. It was inflamed was the one we did. Oh, sorry. I didn't, please. It's so you know how to do it then. Do you remember how to get the knuckle with like, that's good. The heating of like the, um, where like cough, you ock get a little knuckle. Knuckle. Boom. Remember that? Yeah. Kind of. I know. Yes. I remember us doing it. I don't know if I remember all the movements, but I remember like you talk, you got, can you get a hunter in your right hand? Yep. I'll, I'll help. You can grab what you grab. Oh, okay. That's fine. Cool. She's gonna grab it and hand it back to you in a meaningful way. That's not gonna be the real grab. Okay. Grab right next door. Now. Solid. Right there. Solid. Not too much. Just a little. And grab right there. There. Hard. Now pull If you don't slip. Okay, now you're gonna lift it up. Let go of your hand. Okay. Okay. Now go underneath her all the way across. Oh, yep. Now I remember this. The little baby bite and then the cross all the way across. Crush it. Good. That's good enough. Okay. I'm locked. Lock it. You can let it go. I hope you don't have, have fat in there. I think you avoided it. I think I avoided it. I think I went about it. I'm gonna let, let go. Yep. I'm locked. Let's go. And that's good. And then that avoids putting your tips into the middle of a gall ladder. Nice. Yeah. That's really nice. Which especially it's inflamed is not a viable solution. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, do you, diggen, do you mind taking the camera from Kat? I'm, you're gonna be happier if you go. And then once he does, you can grab another grasper. Yeah. Perfect. The question's gonna be, did I really avoid that piece of fat right there? Oh, thank you. And then can we get the room lights down please? Absolutely. Nice. Thank you ladies."
40,"00:28:29,925","00:28:36,655",1 Instruction,1.1 Assessment,They discuss performing or evaluating a dissection or instrument movement.,You dig? Okay. Then she'll take another grasper.
41,"00:28:40,855","00:29:13,285",1 Instruction,1.2 Inquiry,They discuss adjusting the camera or view for better visualization.,"Do you want camera table down or do you wanna step Um, I was gonna say table down. And then actually, should we, before we, should we put her in, um, reverse trend down? You want more head up? Yeah, like more head up? Yeah. Can we get more head up? And then that's good. And we'll get the table down a little bit. Then can we get table down just a bit and she'll tell you when to stop demanding while we got everything positioned. Yeah, we can get spots off. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Did you ladies need light? You good? You're good. Brent. Up to her. That's good. And then we get a little bit more head up."
42,"00:29:16,254","00:31:14,095",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss manipulating or exposing the gallbladder and surrounding tissue.,"We have a footboard, right? Perfect. Yep, we do good. All right. This'll be good. Okay. So let's make sure I got the fat out of that. Not in my jaws, just gentle sweeps, sort of right where the top is. And I would use both hands if you can and just kind of take both pieces down. I would start, yeah, right up, right underneath my jaws. If you can't get there, you can try to find another plane and you can like grab a tiny piece of it and pull straight down. Just don't push into it. Yeah. Nice. And that looks nice and clear. Um, I'm gonna fix your, you must have worked out this morning. Your muscle I rip through. I would try, yeah. I try to grab the really wispy right up at the top, so I'd let go and draw right up at the top. Yeah. Right there with you. Nice. And when I came in the room I was like. Nice. Okay. And then you have to regrab with your left and come back at that area there. Perfect. Nice. And if you can't, you can always like hook right through that clear stuff if you need to, because that's clearly nice and clear. We just don't wanna rip. If we have can't. But you're doing great. Show it to yourself. Nice. Yeah. And you can hook that if you want to. Both this, yeah. Stay right where you are. So when you grab here, you want to rip there, right? But it can rip anywhere between here and there. That's what, yeah. And it's gonna rip in the weakest spot. The weakest spot is actually gonna be the fat. Okay. And what'll happen is you'll rip, the veins will break and it'll bleed and you won't be able to see anything. So you want to grab as close to the plane as you can so you don't rip fat. Okay. Yeah, exactly. You can use, you can always the other side of the plane too,"
43,"00:31:19,665","00:32:10,830",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss adjusting the camera or view for better visualization.,"right? They're. Yeah. They need a little light to get a better view of what we're doing for the research project. Okay. So lemme troubleshoot. Okay. It's easier. You can hook that with your right hand or not. Yeah. I mean, if you can, if you wouldn't, because right there, if you grab right on the edge of that lip rather than the fat, you would've had it. So a smaller, smaller grab Yeah. Of that portion. Yeah, exactly. Nice. And you should be able to pull that down and you can use your right hand for tension against the gallbladder. And if you wanna hook it, you're totally fine to hook it because I don't want you to rip the fat or anything."
44,"00:32:20,610","00:32:30,360",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They confirm that the current action or position looks correct.,"You're good. You're doing great. Yeah. I'd grab right where that thing wants to rip. Yeah, right. Like right there. Yeah. Nice."
45,"00:32:35,100","00:32:54,305",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss performing or evaluating a dissection or instrument movement.,I was just gonna go. Yeah. Yeah. You can get your hook. I would hook it. What? I would hook it. Yeah.
46,"00:33:08,070","00:33:18,270",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss manipulating or exposing the gallbladder and surrounding tissue.,"Yeah. Nice. Now you Yeah, you can heal that if you want to. Perfect. And then keep pulling with your left. Nice. Okay. I'd re grab, um, up on gallbladder."
47,"00:33:22,080","00:33:24,330",2 Management,2.2 Task assignment,They discuss procedural details or coordination during the operation.,"Oh, let's see."
48,"00:33:26,790","00:33:50,370",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They confirm that the current action or position looks correct.,"Just be careful with that grab. You may wanna grab slightly more on that lip. Yeah, right there. Yeah. Nice. Oh yeah. Be careful once it gets too much. Okay. Nice."
49,"00:33:56,370","00:34:47,600",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss adjusting the camera or view for better visualization.,"I wouldn't grab too low. I keep working where you're working on that. Perfect. A little bit. Yeah. You see that plane right there towards posterior, actually this sky right here? Yeah, right there. So if you grab that super wispy white stuff. Close to the gallbladder. Yeah, right there. Nice. That's a nice clear. You should be able to come down with, and you can pull out a hook if you need to, or you can just pull, is this, are you seeing reflection from the light? Me? Uh, my view's still totally fine screen. No, it's fine. You're not, 'cause it's should be bouncing down. Mm-hmm. But I wanna make sure it's not bouncing back to you. No, it's fine. Your image is okay. And you can, um, if you wanna hook that you can or you can keep pulling down. It's okay for now. Yeah. Well not Okay. The surgery. Yeah. Nice. You wanna hook that? If you need to totally fine."
50,"00:34:57,515","00:35:54,720",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss performing or evaluating a dissection or instrument movement.,"Maybe come back for a sec day. 'cause she should find herself. I just called you day. Wow. A little nickname. Sorry. If like, if you were like, Hey, that's not my name, please tell us. Well, I made up a nickname of my own accord. Yeah. Where it's pulling, you have good tension right there. You can come through that wispy with your hook. I wouldn't, yeah. I wouldn't necessarily heal if I didn't have to just poke through. Yeah. Which is fine, but yeah. Nice. Yeah. And then come back through that hole. Nice. And then use your left hand a little bit more to give a better fan to keep that angle nice. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Nice. And now we're getting a little low. Just fine. I'd regrab with your left closer to that whisk."
51,"00:35:59,190","00:36:30,210",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss manipulating or exposing the gallbladder and surrounding tissue.,"Uh, I'll have, I can, I can say like who? Nice. And just make sure you really thin it out. 'cause I can't see through all that fat right now. Yeah, you're good. Maybe grab that other lip. Yeah. I was thinking this other little wispy guy here might be a little, I grab, uh, maybe a little closer to gallbladder. I think you're grabbing a little too low. Yeah."
52,"00:36:36,270","00:36:50,990",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They confirm that the current action or position looks correct.,"And I, yeah. And then use your left to fan sort of lateral if you can. Uh, lateral. Yeah. Yeah. That way you're showing yourself that hole better and stay really thin."
53,"00:36:53,060","00:38:39,825",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss manipulating or exposing the gallbladder and surrounding tissue.,"Yeah. Nice. Now you have that hole. Perfect. Nice. Yeah, she's definitely had some chronic inflammation here. Huh? It's a little thick, but probably just fat. I was just looking to see if anything was down. Yeah, yeah, me too. Before, can you come in a little bit? Taken Nice. Yeah, that looks nice and clear. Just show yourself and use your left hand to keep pulling it lateral. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. See how you're showing it more with that. Nice. Perfect. Okay. Just be careful healing down into that 'cause you're getting close to. All right, well let me pull, do you mind coming back just a hair day again? I wanna take a peek at what kind of, there we go. Great. Nice. Then we'll come in and then Nice in the horizon hall a little bit. Other way. Other way. Uh, it'll be turning your hand and putting like, so this is to you? Yeah. You're gonna have to teach him. Oh my bad. How to do this. Sorry. I was thinking about the, I know dissection. This is the hard part. I know. Teaching to operate is the hardest thing done in my by far, so, so it's a lot of cognitive load. Okay. So you're gonna have to make sure my bad. Pay attention to everything. Right. Cool. And keep grabbing. Yeah. Nice and high on gallbladder. Where that pull that way. Don't pull that way. It's more likely to rip in the plane then and grab closer. Yeah, and I, yeah, like he said, grab closer."
54,"00:38:50,535","00:38:53,385",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss performing or evaluating a dissection or instrument movement.,"Yeah, the end plane pulls. That's a really good point. Dr. George."

See that little lip there? Fat. That's where you wanna be grabbing. I use a Maryland for this. It's usually more precise, but it doesn't matter really. Yeah, that's good. Nice. Good grab. I'm trying to think about how do I get my left hand in there to help me a little bit more? You can, what? What I do is I use my left hand strip and I use my right hand to grab if I want, if I have both. Otherwise, just she's your right hand and you use your right hand against her. Right hand. Okay. Yeah, that's a really good lip grab right there. Nice go. And then pull. Yeah. Nice and down. I think you can get that lip again with your Right. Nice. Good job. This may need to be a left hand lip grab. Yeah, right there. Yeah, exactly. And then remember pulling in planes so it's a little more down than lateral. Yeah, just right here. Here. Up there. Above. Right there. You can't see very well because There you go. There you go. Nice. A little above that."

And then you can rip with impunity because you know where it's gonna rest. Nice. And I'd swing back around digging if you can. Your place playing dancing with her. It's probably mild. Generally speaking here. This instrument, or this is for you, David? The instruments you want to point? Not on the top. It's coming on top. The instrument itself is blocking the view. If it comes off to the side, they can see around. Got it. So right there, she can't see behind her tip. Right. So you're gonna move back and forth and rotate the camera to get these things in corners or sides. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see how low we are. 'cause I'm seeing it's, it takes practice. Yeah. Okay. Nice. All right. Lemme give you a better retraction now that we're pulled a bit. Okay. I think you can get that one. Uh, super wispy lip down. Yeah."

For your learning. Oh yeah. I don't just be careful Too much of that. And you're learning. Yeah. Yeah. This is huge. Alright, sorry to again. So you're pulling up so much, you're making it pad, oh, I'm making it worse. See how it, it should unfold a little bit. It doesn't always work. Let's see. And it's, this is hard though 'cause that left road is like, it's right in the way. Creeping. Yeah."
58,"00:41:40,220","00:49:36,705",1 Instruction,1.3 Validation,They discuss adjusting the camera or view for better visualization.,"We still hang out. It really does. Okay. It's hard to see it as critical structure, so. Exactly. So if you can't see a structure, what can you do? So we can think about's, two options. Think about like camera angle or retraction. Okay, sure. Three options. We can like get the, like see if we can like kind of push this out. Good. That's number two. Yeah. What's the third option? Um, this is really important for laparoscopy. Move the tissue. It's like we do it all the time and I make that like an additional retractor port for that does No, sorry. Move the, move the thing you're operating on so you can move the things around so you can change your angle of view, which he's doing. Mm-hmm. You can change the things around you blocking your view or you can change what you're operating on. Okay. And if you grab the gall port out of the FSA and you're looking around, you can move it to where you can see. Nice. Okay. So we'll get that left hand Good grab like here kind of making sure though that we have like a good left. I don't know about that grab. That's where I wanna work. So there, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Little slip grab you and then pull Jeff Grab. I think you're going to um, be folding the tissue. A hair with that grab, which is like, this is my hardest thing. I'm trying to think of like going lateral like we talked about and kind of like rolling it into my instrument. Oh, you wanna go lateral? So where are you held up? Where you held up? Where do you want to dissect her? To dissect her? I wanna You have Q-tips open by any chance? I wanna get this. She's gonna give you a Q-tip Oh wow. At the screen with Cool. Okay. If the liver over outta the way she exposed for her to be able to see. I wanna get this down and I'm wanna dissect here. So I was trying to figure out how do I grab this, pull away. That's okay. Let still make sure that this, I can access this guy and like these whiskeys right here, I'll try to grab around here. I think that's a, that's gonna rip. Yeah, that's too, uh, you need a lot of tissue so it has more integrity. Yeah, exactly. So avoiding grabbing that and grabbing more on this side with. More tissue. So what I'm starting to see is this is gonna be in Right, exactly. I think we can, that's gonna be that turn. Mm-hmm. I talked about on this, on this model here. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And then this stuff, you're still looking for that. I don't know where it is. I don't fat over there. Right. But we'll see it. Okay. That's where probably you're end up doing that move where you pull it out and suck it in. I'll, I bet you. But she's gotta get gun grab to really make a point. Right? Yeah. 'cause you know this is gonna roll. Right. Right. Okay. Now to get this down is our next step. I feel like we could either, I don't know if you're a big kitten or person versus just continuing to get, like, Marilyn, make a plane. Hook it. Sure. I, I am a, I'm fine kidding nurse, but I will usually don't use just Marilyn. Okay. I mean, it's not super in plain anything. I usually use a sucker if it's bad enough. Okay. And I think your left hand isn't helping you yet. No. Yeah. I think we were just, you know, coach her. Tell me what you want, not what you don't want. Okay. What do you want? I think I still want a bit more tissue. If you can get it. This is hard, Kat. This is the hardest part, in my opinion. Truly the problem is maybe I'm screwing you up. Maybe I'm holding too hard. Yeah, I'd grab right around there air. So I think it's too, the area you're making is you're not opening your grasper enough. That's okay. And put it all the way up. Push it all the way in. Okay. Right there. Yeah, push it all the way in now grab now. That's a good bite. Nice. Okay. And then you can, um, palm if you, if you're able Yeah, definitely palm. Yeah. I made my thumb numb for six months when I didn't palm. Oh yeah. That makes me so sad. It was a, it was a me problem. It. Cool. Um, I'm trying to think about Nice. I think Deon, if you don't mind coming back for a hot sec just so I can orient myself. Yeah. Okay. Nice. Yeah. See, I feel like I see that turn coming in there, so we're gonna have to clear off this area. Yeah. Yeah. If you're able to thin out any of that tissue, keeping that good pull with your left that you had, I think that, that gallbladder, I still think we're zoomed in. I hear too much. Yeah, I agree. There's such a bad glare. Yeah. Let's, let's clean it and just like chill for a hot sec. Okay. Okay. Because we gotta get that down. And once we have that down, you'll be able to get a better pull and we'll get a better idea of our anatomy. And then I know he likes to work sort of in that space right by the liver. Mm-hmm. First, yeah. My glasses. Is that what you're laughing at? No, I'm not laughing at all. I'm appreciating this moment. This is wonderful. Isn't this wonderful cat doing? We're helping this patient first and foremost, which is great. And second of all, you guys are learning. You're working together. Cat's doing a great job. We're all learning, frankly. It's great. Okay, so let's get re get that. Good grab. You had Kat. Oh, not too high. Your camera angle should be between, generally between 10 and two o'clock. Like where And you're, yeah. Generally between 10 and two. If you're on the left side over here looking here, it'll be 10. If you're over here it'll be two. Okay. Okay. We'll go. But you can definitely vary between, between two. Feel free to Okay. But you almost never should be looking straight off, unless you're simply looking at your abdominal wall. I feel like that's distorting our anatomy, but I think that you're still in step three. Yeah. I think the grab is just still gonna get that stuff done. Yeah. Okay. I think there's more to go. Okay. But, and I think it's too high. Is that what you say too? Yeah. Too high. And I think that it's getting, um, twisted. It's hard to see. Like can you, can you do us a favor and just move this liver outta the way for a second? Let's just take a look. Yeah. What we got over there? Okay. And then can you grab right there? Kind of, this is in pw. You see it there? Yeah. Grab right in in. Be grabbing some of that fat. There's vessel arter, arteries there. Arties there. That ridge. The ridge is there. Artery almost certainly. Push in. No, no, no. Come on. That's it. Now pull this way towards the hip. It's hard. You got it. It's the hardest part of the truly seven year program. You're good. I still struggle with the ground crushed. Yeah, you're not, you're not getting your, once you push in, push in and engage. There you go. Now grab it. That's it. Nice. Okay, now let's look behind here. Megan, you do at too nice. Okay. Okay, so I see gallbladder here still. So it's gonna be down there, I think. Which is hard. Yeah's, that's just hard. So I, but I see this here, so I'm gonna guess it's right there. So, because you can't see back here, I would actually start just scoring right there to be honest. You think so that Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't ask you what you want to do that. No, that's why I'm, that's totally fine. I would love What are you thinking? I think it's little too late. No, that's fine. I was gonna say, I think we could take this shitty tissue there, you that for sure. And get that down percent that may give, give us a little more freedom. So that's good. And I'm sorry I didn't say that explicitly. I was wondering if we do that too, but if we're too low, we're doing stuff we don't need to do. It's not useful. I don't think we are. I think that's stuff's actually very useful. I think plane wanted come across this here. Yeah, I think so too. Okay. Because I could see our gall water turning there. Yeah, I that's what I'm seeing too. Yeah. Okay, great. In, in whatever order you wanna do, that's fine. As long as we have the same mental model. Yeah. Up to you Kat. If you want to keep thinning with that versus if you wanna do like layer by layer, getting through, through hook thinning and taking it. Good technique. I think layer like going. Um, let's see. Where if like taking a layer helps out. Yes, I think so too. I think that, um, it'll be better with the hook faster and, uh."

As long as she's making progress. My general policy keep going, but there's always a limit to it. Okay. And keep that good tension that you had with your left hand 'cause that was showing it to you. Um, out not, not up that way. It's okay. Sorry. Do you ever use a locking grasper on the gallbladder if it's not inflamed or No. 'cause it concussion. So it's interesting because I'm an a CS surgeon, it's very rare that we have a gall bladder that looks like this. Yeah. And any of the gall, go ahead, please. Oh no, I was gonna say nice cat. Yeah, that's where you need to get under is that lip right there. Push, push, push. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. Almost never. 'cause it's lacerating and inflamed tissues. Nice. Okay. Pull out and take it. Great. That's exactly what we're gonna keep doing is working through that schmutz there. Nice technique. You know, I go, she knows this, who we talking? Go into that and sweep up and down. Yes. Because that's actually dissecting it off of the ductal structure. And you need to, so once you get into that plane sweep, if you're gonna use hook for d dissection, which I love to do, I'm just Yeah, no, you're okay. Having a hard time. There's nothing there. You're fine. Gotta just keep yeah, keep with that left hand tension too, because that'll give you something to work against. She's not getting anything because there's nothing to get. She's okay. All right. So we should switch what we're doing then. Okay. So now we can start, what Dr. George was saying would be our decision to score. Nice. There. Go. Yeah. That's a, that's nice. Are here almost. I think so. Let's look. Careful. So that's our careful, I wanna say because yeah, yeah. You're doing it. Looking at your looking where we were talking to. Okay. I think that's the, like ous coming down to that Arc Q. So I'm almost seeing this right here. Is that where you guys are seeing like that little lip there? Yeah. ' cause that's where we're gonna want to get everything down. So I would come right here. Okay. So see if I stretch what I would go slightly slower. Okay. And the reason is, I see this, see this right here and then an inflection point, right? Mm-hmm. That little, like you can see this. So if you imagine where base is, base is probably right there. Mm-hmm. Right now let's look over here. Right. I don't see a lot over there to help us. That's gallbladder there. Gallbladder there. Don't know down there. So I would be aiming here because I know that there's gallbladder there. Right there. I can see it. Yep. Move your thing. Um, so there's gallbladder there. I know. I don't know what's there. So I wouldn't head down into nothing. I just scared. Right. So I'd head from there to there, which gives me right there, which is slightly lower than you guys. Slightly lower. So that's why. Okay. Got it. Okay. So I'd start right there. Yeah, exactly. Right there. That might be a no in there. It's a weird spot for No, but it sure looks like that. Kind of looks like a nerve right here. Yep. Sure. Yeah. Just get through peritoneum. Yeah. So you'll just, boop zoo going, keep going through, through it. There you go. One more. Oh, that's good. Alright. You're aiming for here? Yep. Not down there. Nice. Wiggle, pull noise and then get back in your hole. Yeah. You aim aiming, see how you're aiming down. Nice. You fix it. Seeing it, you, you, you angles this way needs to be like that. Okay. Because you're gonna go around the backside here. Nice. Sorry. Nice. And make sure you thin it. Do the little sweeping. The technique here is you turn it sideways, push in with the heel. Okay. Push in, dissect in, dissect in. Don't turn it yet. That's sharp. There you go. Push in. Push in in the plane. Okay. Nice. Okay. And then turn it and now sweep again. And if it rips, that's a good thing. Great."

I feel like this is super glar and I'm, I'm like a little nervous to like, you know what I mean? I don't know Leah. No. Yeah, you're good. I think you have one more lip you can take right there. I was thinking like this guy right here. Exactly. Yeah. Nice. And just pull out. Nice. Bless you. Actually pretty good. Yeah, it is. I see your edge there, aren't we? I think, yeah. I think that's one more fat lip you can take right there. Cat. Getting your heel back in. That nice, that hole. Exactly. Perfect. Okay. Do you want to, um, pull your gallbladder medial and take a peek at what you're seeing on this side of that dissection plane? Yeah. Nice. I think that, that you can come through that part right there. This stuff, right? Yeah. That schmutz. Yeah. Staying in that same plane and saying high up on gallbladder. Push through the heel. Get some dissection. Yeah, because you, you freebie here, you're gonna be there anyway. Yeah, yeah. Right there. Yeah. The base is here. That's somewhere else. Yeah. And push through. Nice, nice.

So I'm imagining right there is base in that little blackness. Okay. I couldn't imagine. But the reason it looks like fullness coming down. We saw this here, like I think, I bet you there's nothing there. I mean, there's liver there eventually, right? That's the anatomy I'm seeing. I agree. It, it looks like to me. Yeah. But I'm not totally sure what's going on over here. It looks, no, I don't wanna go over there. I'm not sure yet. No, I don't, I'm not saying avoid it. I'm just, I don't clarity yet. Right. We're talking about speed before. Exactly. Clear. Understanding the anatomy is super fast, right? I mean, I slow down. What? I don't know. Okay."

I want you to go into that plane that is all floppy there. Yeah. I want you to go in solidly and I want you to not pull back as you turn, but actually almost push in as you're turning. Okay. Try it out. Nope. Start sideways like this. And then like that. Like this, like this. You're like that right now. You wanna be like that on the hook. Push in with the heel like you were doing. You're just doing this way. Go right there. Push in. Push in more. Turn while you're pushing and it should pop through. Okay. That's it. Now you can wiggle it through if you want, but that's how you keep it hooked. Okay. How it kept falling off of you. 'cause you were kind of like, like not quite like not in there, you know?

I know it's a, yeah, it's aggressive, but it's hard to get in heel there. Yeah. And you can make pretty good progress with these scores. The risk though, for you, the risk is it's getting the liver, it's super easy to go on the hook and it folds over and you hook behind. This is gallbladder. Mm-hmm. You have CISO here, you think you're in this plane and it, it folds over and you actually get a, a nub and a gall bladder. Oh, gotcha. So that's the risk of hooking. Just make, think about your uh, left hand too. If you're struggling. That's my usual thing. If I'm struggling, I'll say, what is my left doing? Your left hand sabotaging you right now? Because I think you're almost pushing it in. She's absolutely pushing in. That crevice is her left hand. Yeah. Look the back digging with the camera. See where your left hand is. Yeah. You wanna be pulling it. See how you're making a hole there for yourself? Oh, sorry, cat. See that line? That's your left hand. Yeah. From the grab it, pull straight out right over and try and straighten it to this out more. And it maybe just the wrong grab for you to get that corner and if it is, we can always work somewhere else and then come back to that with the new, grab a little lower and I'll free that part up. You know. Cool. I think I, yeah, you can regrab. Good job not slipping. Yeah. Truly might be artery coming in on that, but Right in that I think is where artery is. Okay. I think artery's gonna be right in there. Yeah. I think we, I think it's hard to know for sure, but I think we saw it. Yeah. Still tough. Um, but I think you can maybe get one more move here and if it's not working, we can go somewhere else. The technique there was. You know your left hand when you're on this backside. Careful the liver. Yeah. Watch out. Yeah. Um, when your, um, left hand's in your own way. Mm-hmm. Your left hand. That's the principle she used. Okay. If it's in your way, let's go somewhere else then if it's not working. So we started our dissection coming along here. We know we wanna angle back towards the liver, so let's start doing that part of the dissection. And we know arties somewhere in here, right? So we'll save super, um, superficial layer by layer and show it. And duct too is a posterior probably do need. Yeah. The heel only works when you're on that way on the backside. That's a very specific technique to that. Okay. And the thing I want to keep in mind is that we are twisting this fat a little. So when we come across, we don't wanna dig. So just stay in nice and superficial there. There you go. That's your point. Yeah. Nice. And just show it nice and thin. Yeah. And see I want to, so you can see your tip there, right? Yeah. That's so meaningful. It's beautiful. Is that enough photos to it to like take it or That's it. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. What, why? Sorry, I don't understand your question. Like I just wanted to make sure that I saw enough and that it wasn't thin. It was thin enough. I was there that like, 'cause you also were going in and felt it and it wasn't thick, right? No, it was very thin. So it's cool seeing it and feeling it. Yeah. Get right. Yeah. That's a perfect plane right there. Nice. Good job. That's what I was saying is like, I felt like this. Yeah, you had a little extra stuff but it was fine. You like where she's headed? Um, almost. You get nice. Yeah, because I felt like before, like I said, I was just a little Alright. And just think about how you're pulling, make sure your left is still helping you. Nice. That was a nice adjustment. Coaching."

Use your left hand. There you go. You're good. It's okay. Just watch your Bovie. Is that a purposeful move or accidental? That was accidental. That was my fault. Luckily it was actually productive. 'cause you were kind of dissecting everything up. I think you have one more move going posterior. Yeah. You can't see the tension on it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's the, that's really good. Maybe it takes more than one. Yeah, maybe one more. Nice. Yeah, perfect. Right in that whole, and we'll just pull carefully so we don't whack the little off. That's little thick, right?

You can't go up but I think you're a little deep. Yeah, that's how I know. Just try and come in with the camera for her. Yeah. There's that top lip where that's what I was. Yeah. You gotta be deep that vessel once you get there. Okay. Exactly. And you can do that. Good sweep and dissection here that you've been doing. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Maybe just take that whole thing. I dunno. Just don't go halfway across that vessel. That's all I really care about. If you're gonna go deep to it. Yeah, that's good. Don't pull hard when you're moving up because you'll it before. It cooks. Some good buzzes through. It's good. You pulled too hard. Okay. Get it rip before you problem, because that's really important part to be able to see. Yeah, I wouldn't keep pushing into it just a little bit here. Don't burn there again. Where we're right here. No on top of it because that's. Okay. Do you wanna come up this lip here? Or we can keep working back there. What do you wanna do? I almost feel like it's kind of coming up a little bit this way, but I wanna see how it, like with the, okay. And if it's, I guess. She's good. Yeah. There we go. Nice. Give a good pull with that left. Nice. Nice. That's really good. Yeah. So principal here, you guys, both of you. Mm-hmm. So you know you don't wanna be burning when it's touching the gallbladder 'cause you make a hole in the gallbladder, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. But you don't wanna pull super hard 'cause you want to coagulate vessels before they rip. Yeah. That's where I feel like I, so there's a tension. Mm-hmm. The way you reconcile that is you go in, you sweep, so you have auto mobility to get it away from gallbladder without having to pull hard. Mm-hmm. Okay. So that's why I'm sweeping is I'm developing the plane so that I can kind of pull just enough to get the hook off the gallbladder but no more. Got it. Nice. Okay. Like this kind of where we're sitting here. Sure. That looks better. Let's see if it cooks. Yeah. That looks better. Right? Yeah. Nice. It took about half second to come through and then, and it's really important with vessels, right? Because you can't pull hard on those. Yeah. Left hand. Is your left helping you or hurting? Yeah. Figure out how to, with my left. How to pull better out. You may just be running out of it. I think we're running out. Yeah, if we're running out, let's come back down. Okay. Next step. So get this there if you don't mind. So yeah, next step is actually not quite that. Um, it's gonna be not, yeah, I would probably turn my, like that come underneath. Come on This side of it. This guy right here? Yeah, but I, yeah, that's fine. Slide it down. There may be node right around it or duct. She has dilated ducts. Get some. Weird thing though. It almost looks like there's a plane here to move the way it moved. Looks like a note or something like it. Does it look like an So see how that moves independently of this? When you touch it, touch it again. See Yeah. Move. Right. This doesn't move at all. No. So it suggests to me there's a plane there. Yeah. Okay. Now just be careful 'cause now what you actually want to do though is you have a peritoneal covering here with leaflet. Mm-hmm. Okay. What you wanna do is actually grab that and just peel it back. Yeah. Perfect. It's the most efficient way to just expose that space and then you're gonna be left the fat structures and peritoneal on the other side. Perfect. Okay. Marilyn to pull or That's what I use. Yeah. 'cause it's curved or right angle. 'cause you want to grab a broad base. You don't want to grab a little bit of it Exactly right. Because it'll rip. Right. And then, and then ka The thing to think about is Maryland, Marilyn. Yeah. Is how you're pulling. 'cause you're gonna pull in the direction of the tissue, like the plane. And that way it should pull easy. Just like if you were doing open surgery. The same sort of tension principles. So guys, yeah. Do this. Let's have her do this. And I don't wanna talk about time and then we, because I remember we wanted to talk, clip it. Um, so you can get a along one tie on that side of the plane. One tie on another side of the plane. Yeah. Nice. And then I remember we like wanted a little more like, like this so that you're like grabbing like that, like that and pulling across a broad base of your instrument. And then I remember having a little piece of, a little bit, almost like in the crotch, Dr. George, say again, like you had almost a little bit of it going towards like the crotch of the Maryland a little bit. Uh, as much as you can get. It doesn't matter where. Yeah. It's as big as you want because physics where it's dripping. If it's plane, you keep going. If not, I see. Don't, yeah. That's a really productive one. Yeah, it was. I was just gonna be a little smaller. Yeah. Out. Sometimes when you gr grab just a little bit, you pull and it bleeds. So if you can spread the tension out across more tissue, where did ripped, I dunno if you noticed it ripped in the fat out of the plane. Exactly. Yeah. Grouping the fat, not the plane. I'm trying to figure out if I wanna, because I wanna be in this. Not yet. No, not there yet. The step here is take this peritoneal stuff down. That's all you're doing. You're all the way over to the fossa. So this stuff here, then that's enough. You don't need more there. It's this stuff up here that you care about. Okay. And you can pull your left hand at a slightly different angle to fix that. Yeah. Nice to get this. So we're going with this, this stuff right here? Yeah. And you can, there looks to be a lip up here that I would try to grab. The reason I have Q-tips is I go to point and then I get my finger dirty and I gotta change my gloves. I'll take a Q-tip. I am a pointer apparently. That's why I do it. Oh no. For laparoscopy, it's way, way better. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I should. Yeah. No, you're doing good. Pulls well with this technology is you can look and, and I just, I think the future is, I'm gonna be able this look where I'm looking and, and have it show on their screen and I wouldn't pull back there anymore. So I think it's gonna happen. Yeah. So what I wanna do is I wanna get where AI will show you. Yeah, yeah. Dr. George for, for this next step, um, we still have more, we need to clean off here and we need to get our posterior cleaned off. I wouldn't worry about the posterior yet. Not yet. Okay. And sometimes you don't have to worry about it at all. Okay. So, so you see that's smooth here. That's smooth. See, it's rough all here. Yeah. It's the smooth, which is peritoneum and it needs to come down. Okay. The only thing I wanna point out to you see how it looks like there's a band here? Yeah. Why do you think there's a band holding, uh, the peritoneum up Right here? Yeah. Um, 'cause of like the, um, 'cause I didn't go through like the per for it or why do you think there's a band holding the peritoneum up there? Are you talking about structures in it? I will you tell me why is this trung up? Oh, because of the weight of the, um, anatomy's actually formed. There's an artery under it. Yeah. It's guaranteed. Yeah. It's holding everything up. Ductal s you stretch your left hand out, it's just the artery like here and it goes dway. Okay. So there's an artery there, which is great. You wanna expose it. So if you grab the perone over the top of it, you'll actually start to see it. Okay, cool. Look right here. Yeah. You keep going there. I want you up there. Yeah, so like Right that, but uh, hard to do it that way, but you can try trying to take a bigger bite. Don't grab the artery. Yeah, I know. I'm trying to think about how, yeah, yeah. And you just saw it. It's pretty shitty, but I know I'm just little bigger about how to get at, how to hold it, but like, okay. Don't get too aggressive. Don't get greedy. Get what you get and then stop and re recalibrate. There you go. That's it. Now you're doing, so this is a really fast way to, to skeletonize ductal structures in the cystic triangle. Okay. Okay. Okay. There's a couple more techniques that help this too, but a weak sauce. There's a Please. I was gonna say, I think that there's a tension plane here you could pull, but. Try it. Pull on it or, yeah, right here. That was a good problem. Perfect. Okay. There's another technique, kind of the roll technique for grabbing this technique. You want this in your, in your thing, but you want to garage base. So what you gonna do is you're gonna take your time, you're gonna push in and then push that way. Actually it'll bring that up into your, into your instrument. We're trying to get that numb in instrument. That's it. And then grab it. Okay. And I don't think your tips grabbing anything else. And I'll try and rip down. So not quite big enough. So you're gonna have a little farther past to do that same move. It's hard. That's it. That'll work."

Your plane's right? Nope. You grabbed off plane one. This is your plane this time. Above the plane. This time. Below the plane. That's your plane right there. That's it. Nice. Good job. Ka Like the plane is, that's your plane right there. So you wanna go above? Yeah, but put your, set that time just above the plane and push in and then grab. That's it. That's the move. That's the most efficient way of dissecting a plane. Oh, beautiful pool right there. Nice. That's probably as much as it's gonna give you there. Okay. I'm still seeing gallbladder there. I know, I, it's kind of weird, huh? I'm wondering if we could thin and come across the anterior to it. Yeah. What the hell's going on? I just still don't understand the anatomy. Yeah. So it feels weird because it looks like, I feel like I still see stuff going like right here. Is that what you guys are talking? Maybe? Yeah, I think that might be gallbladder, but who knows? It's weird. Oh, okay. I'm gonna ask you guys to switch. I'm only gonna do it 'cause we were doing this for two hours now. Yeah. Okay. Oh, and I don't think we need to be through the cystic di dissection hour though, actually. Right. For an easy one. So hopefully you feel like you've gotten enough learning. I got, yeah, I got good. Okay. Why Don you guys switch? I'm not at all. I promise. Today was very great. Thank you. Yeah. And some that was Rich. Can't learn everything in one session. No. While you guys are switching. So yeah, this hasn't touched anything yet. Nope. Okay. I was good about it. Okay. Just wanna make sure I set down again. Here's this little guy. Thanks. Good job. Yeah, you did really far. Very good tip. Are good technical learning for you? I had really good coaching. Oh, sweet. Really good. It's all these little minutes. Thank you. You know that you, when you're learning mind if I get a step over here continue. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. My, that's interesting. Yeah. I think that that very weird. It's gotta be, I think that's in particular. Yeah. I'm gonna regrab just 'cause it has a double arc. One on these side. You know what's going on with this, but I feel like I learned a lot. Thank you guys. There we go. It's important for your future patients. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Oh, I see. So I think you're gonna, yeah, generally speaking, I find it y at this phase. Thank you. Okay. Honestly, because the reason is you want to put the cystic duct on scratch. Oh, my bad. Yeah, I agree. I'm gonna, I'm gonna tint with my right and then regrab it, my left. Thank you. You came in before you kind of like came in, rolled it, and then moved it on the in field before when we were doing the other, um, lady talking. Yeah. Is this kind of where you were talking about where you pushed it in and you rolled it and we pushed a little back, uh, with the, your hand cat. We, right now we we're gonna grab below the artery, typically. Will you come in dig? Yep. Just trying to see exactly where I wanna grab, I think lower. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. See what that gives you. Then we push a, a hair more cat on. Yeah. Are you not able to push back more with your Yeah. Okay. Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not super convinced by that. Let's, so Ken, your job is to push the edge. That's how you know you pushed it up. Yeah. It's not ripping off and you elevated all the cystic stuff out of the. The fsa, but not so much. The liver folded over. Nice. So you're gonna experiment with those three variables, you to see which one is best for her. Let's take a peek exactly what we think is going on. What do we think? What do we think? It's hard to tell actually. Super hard to tell. Oops, sticky. I just wanna make sure we're thinking correctly about where her infundibulum is good, because she has dilated ducts. So I don't wanna get, you know, confused and go too low. Here's our sulcus of per se. Above that, I mean, maybe I'll take some of this. I don't know if we need to, but if we take some of this down."

So I would actually, uh, I pull everything out so I can see. Now it's like, is this node sure, maybe I don't know. Or is this, I don't know. I don't know. So where it's safe. So where is it? Safe? Well, safe technically is higher and posterior. We that those are safe. Yeah, there's, there's several Parents are safe shortly. You can go there if you wanted it. Or you can go medially this, this fat, you know, you could start to bring that fat down too. Okay. That's gonna be safe. As long as you're careful, right? You don't want, this is not where you aggressively engaged and instrument can really see what goes and then feel around in there. Feel free to fill the doc. And we don't know our base is, no I don't. So we think our pops to either their note or it or it's a Right, right. But if it's, if it's, it's in the base is gonna be there. So I wouldn't spread up there. 'cause that could be dull. I think it might be. Yeah. So this is nice fast cat here. We saw the artery earlier. Where was that? That white right there. That's a safe spot. Use the landmark. You come just medial. Just lateral. See if it gives it to you. Okay. Maybe like. In here. Sure. Try it up. If it gets it to you, it feels Looks pretty empty. It does it. You push in and it goes in. Yeah. That's a freebie. You're gonna get all the way through on that. I bet you just trying to make sure feels okay and make sure we don't see any white. You wanna look in that hole with, there you go. Good job. Yep. Now it feels like nothing. Burger, right? It does. Feels like absolutely nothing because you're past the dock. All right, push in, engage, push in, engage. That's it. Now, push in hard, not engage. That's it. Okay. So we're technically through. If you know a safe spot, just go for it. That's speed. Make sure you keep her. Yeah. But you know the anatomy move faster. Focus. Okay. Okay. Now you're red ductus. Yeah. Or something. Theoretically anterior to me. Okay. A safe spot here. I'm gonna do one more. Good. Spread. Engage. We don't think we're too low. We don't know. Okay. It's safe here. Okay. All right. You don't know where base, I don't know, but I feel like I can come here. I that too. Good. That's exactly where I would've gone. Pushing a lot harder. There you go."

So she's bringing it up, she's doing that to stay close to dock again is one of the 10,000 things. Right. She's demonstrated multiple really fast. Okay. And if you're able to swing around and pop on this side, we'll see it on through. Yeah. Nice. Thanks, Degan. Okay. That was great. Now you know our base. I can take that. Yep. You can see in there there's base. Mm-hmm. Okay. Now we're, again, now we're covered with gas. Right? Okay. We're talking about speed before. All right, well, I'm gonna, I, I was gonna get my hook and take some of this down. Sure. Go for it. Cool. Could be a, a artery coming through there. Remember? Could be all Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, that's not an artery, right? Just move like an. Nice and thin. Okay. Yeah. Do it. It's not our, don't pull so hard though, because there's true fat, fat vessels. Okay.

Oh, not you, her. I was like, I am. I know you are. Okay, because you have to go next. No, I'm thinking like that was what I was thinking earlier is putting her stuff in there because that was clear and almost like you could see if you could get a lip in there that off big sweep, aggressive sweep all the way up and down. Even rips. It's okay. Big sweep. 'cause that's gonna be where we clip, so we need length there. Okay. Right. That, that's actually very helpful to think about the big sweep. Yeah.

Okay, great. How? Get to the, here we go. Big sweep here too. Strip that off, that duct. That's it. That's the move. And then don't pull so hard when you're doing it because you, sorry, that was my thought was continue cleaning some of that off. Working through what she's working through right now. Okay, now you, so it's a test, right? I just broke answers that are correct. But I, you should always be thinking, what would I do next? And when she does that next and it works, you're like, okay. And if what you want to do next, she never does. You should wonder why big sweeps there. So you see edge of duct right now? I do saw, right? Yeah. You're brief. That I'm staying away for. So you're almost in the wrong place to do your dissection. Ah, okay. You know what I mean? Because you're gonna, if you cut this, you have less tissue there to do your sweet width. Oh. So I should not plan. So just come out. Okay. You go into the right plane now you know where it's go right next to it. Get a lot of tissue there. Still not getting enough. That's better. That's okay. It is what it's, and sweep up it out aggressively very aggressively. Even more aggressive. Rip it go, don't you? I'm ripping. I'm ripping. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And then clear off. See, I'm missed it. I know. I'm trying to get in there. Yeah. That was a good move. Noting I see my plane there. Okay. Yeah. Too much digging. Oh, I see it right there. Right there. Hanging out. Yeah. Totally. Okay, so there's, keep going. I'm just gonna talk. Okay. So, uh, there's some risk in this. Yep. Because we're going in, we're picking things out and we can't really see on this side. On the medial side, you can see really well and I, these moves pick me easier here. I do them, but they're a little riskier. Right. I really like keep doing what you're doing, actually. Stay there. Okay. I really like scoring on this side though, because I do too. It releases it. I can pull it out farther and I, I'm coming through fat. I can do nothing. There's no perine blocking, you know, so I, you know, it has to be cut regardless. So you left hand in your own way a little bit. So I was thinking about it, but it's currently fine. Get one or you get one more give up. That's really nice though, right? We're starting to see base over there now. Okay. I see my duct coming in nice and clean. I think I can still clean the duct. Really doing well here. I think I can still clean behind my duct. Yeah, you can't, but what? It's up to you. But remember how we got started at this? Mm-hmm. We were, we pulled this down. You're like, where do we go? Right. We knew one thing. What did we know artery was. Mm-hmm. We use that as our starting point. Okay. Okay. You still know where artery is? Mm-hmm. And you can use the same principle now to take your Maryland on the other side of it. You know exact words. You can feel it. It's very solid. You can feel your way just lateral to that. Okay. With, I mean, appropriate caution, right. Because there could be things coming across. Right. Okay. But you know, there's something there that you can skeletonize."

Yeah, that's what I do. Okay, because you'll be fast. Turn to gauge. That feels like absolutely nothing. Your technique's off you beating on for technique. Yes. So do it again. Okay. I want you to watch this time. What happened? You're upper time. Do it again. Shoot. Don't change the data. You changed something. Did I? You changed the thing you needed to change. You rotated it down. Maybe I just thought about it more. When you rotate it up, you're just pushing down it and this one doesn't engage. Okay. You're not dissecting, so you rotated down there. Both engaged. You press them both in, there's friction. Got it. And bam, you're ready? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So your angle is when you see it fly like that, it's okay. Just adjust. Okay. But you did it three times without adjusting. Leah, come on. It's okay. But then when I asked you, you subconsciously adjusted. It's ruined my teaching point. Everyone still saw the flailing, so, so I don't know. It's bleeding. Maybe fat, maybe known through free for you. Right. So, but there could be something. Yeah, see where you're on the other side. Just because I'm, see if you can switch over. There you go. No left hand. Maybe my ankles off yourself. No, I can't. I think maybe eye angles off of that. I go little harder. I dunno. I think you're good. You think so? Yeah, sure isn't nice. Well look at base on a second. This is interesting. So I don't, it almost looks like it's there, but then it looks white here and we dissect it over there. So I don't know what's, I actually don't know. That sure looks like base though. But this also looks like gallbladder. It sure does. That's a very odd, so that just means slow down so we don't understand anatomy, right? Yeah. So anyway, you're down here. You could be lower than we think. Yeah, I agree. Right. That being said, I think you're okay to go through there and get it out. Get up the other side. Okay.

How do you feel about getting our, that what you wanna do? It's gonna come around the back of gallbladder to get our cystic plate. Cool. Yeah, there's lots of things you could do here. Well what would you do? Uh, well would I do? Well you gotta clear off the base, right? Yeah. So, and you've gotta skeletonize the ducks. Those are two things you have to do, right?

I'm gonna get burned by one of those. I dig in back there. It's good to see that. I supposed to do clip clip. Cut off the Foss. Yeah. Thank God she's back from public school. God bless. Teachers. You did homeschooling for one year? Yeah, I took a year off and we lived in an rv. Oh yeah. So we had to homeschool. We did a terrible job. Job. I did a drill job on everything but geometry. I filled it with geometry. Where'd you guys travel? Mostly out last we were climbing. So nice. Appreciate teachers. Yeah. I mean, I've always appreciated teachers, but I really appreciate It's really hard. You good? Yeah, no, I was gonna say, I never truly came to appreciate our, like some of the stats programs. All I had to do was put the data and I didn't have to calculate any of those. Like, you know what I mean? You're like, why did I need to know Data error. No, I mean it's like important to know it, but I'm like, I don't want to have to like, you know what I mean? Like having to calculate all that stuff. I just remember with like genetics and everything, how we were doing that. Oh, it was painful. One of my very close friends is doing his PhD right now. He's taking a very high level stats. He's like God's gift to me when I'm doing research. It's cool. A very good biostatistic biostatistician work for weight and gold. That's for sure. I, so I did a master's education, but it was really a master's in Stats for education. So I really love stats. Little hooky part, you know, goes in the back. Mm-hmm. So I always fix that before I get in so I don't have to puts around. Okay. Perfectly loaded. Thank you. Okay. Wanna see the back? All right. Now let's look to the confluence. Nice. I think about right there. Yeah. I think that's great. Good job. Those are lovely, aren't they? I like 'em a lot. I just, I'll think another piece. Secure, especially with me too. I feel very secure. This is actually, she had dilated ducts and she has that stint like she needs She could pressure. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. This is great. I don't wanna sit. Let's put four of them on. I can't tell if you're serious or kidding. Not serious. Okay. Putting, like, you lined up your clip before you went in. Yeah. I like to go in and get it on the back. Oh, she switched it. So the angle's different. Mm-hmm. So she had the backside on the, what is now the, the tearing towards you. Yeah. You gotta come, come out. Because what changed now is you have it facing down. Mm-hmm. You want the knob behind your duct, right? Yep. But now you have it facing down and your angle across the duct is not the same. Okay. Before she loaded, I'm gonna come fully out. Okay. Come out and have it reloaded. Okay. So we're gonna want to, so this one's here. Yeah. So knob on that side. Thanks."

Yeah, I'll do that if you don't mind. Yeah, yeah. Course. Because it'll be done. Just figured I'd clarify. Perfect. Uh, not, not perfect. We'll try it. I think it's wrong. You had it scooped up with the knob behind you, right? Mm-hmm. The first time. Yep. Yeah, I think, lemme see. Yeah. So it's gotta be the exact opposite. So scooped up. It's a on that side. Okay. I think it's where the, on that side. Thankfully my PhD wish we had programs at the. Way. Can we just turn it this way? Sure. No, because the angle, here's why. See the angle, it's 30 degrees. If you turn it there, it's 30 degrees that way it's a 60 degree angle difference and it actually messes us up for getting up parallel and perfectly placed. So this is our last chance. Sure. Hungry. Did I eat? Yeah, I did. We thought that last time. I even eat too, but I feel like I've been hungry as a rotation. I don't know if it's because I'm running around more can wake all day. I could be wrong sometimes we're not out. I'm excited though. Our tomato plans finally. How's it looking? We're good. Okay. So next one we'll be facing that way and really shot."

Sweet. I'll take one more Vore. Thank you. There's a little bit of schmutz there, so I'm gonna try to like slide it up. Yeah, we'll see. It's here for you. Um, oh, sorry. And then you mind pushing up a little bit. Kad over the Interesting. Yeah. Can you read, um, it's like twisting. I, I think you're pushing to the Yeah, exactly. That's better. That's nice. Actually, maybe that made it worse. And you can always use a clip player here if you need to. Okay, sure. Okay. Because you can not get it all the way around and it's specimen, it doesn't matter. Right. I'm gonna just see my posterior time, which I do not see. Just use a clip. Sorry. Okay. I was gonna say just use a clip. Yeah. No, I don't like that. I don't, you can't feel it because your duct flow's not very long, you know? Yeah. If you are able to do it, you're gonna be really close. I'd rather have more duct in a shitty specimen closure, I think. Okay. Or you could skeletonize more, but that's not a good use of time.

Yeah, but we maybe, well, I'll just leave it, sit there for just a few off. I mean, you know, sir, we never change her mind. Right? Come. Hope she doesn't have a drop stone. What? Hope she doesn't have a dropped. We also never lie about time because she has the, she already has the stricture. Yesterday, I think I said maybe she should get an ERCP after Ask Dr. George or some, Hey, Dr. George, since she has a stricture already, we don't know if she has a drop stone. Should we just keep her and like get LFTs and, or would you just let her go home and She's got a stent? She does have a stent for her to obstruct. She still has. Okay. Okay. So because her, her stent has, has occluded once. So, I mean, I don't how long. Okay. No, I wouldn't keep it. Do you want me to try to, uh, suck up the stone if you Oh, do you have a 10 milliliter, um, uh, suction tip catheter. Gotcha. We don't have a big one. I can go get one. Oh, it's not in the set? No. Let's see. We'll see if this sucks it up. It might. How about I wander that way? So that sounds like a great idea. Okay. Your suction is on it. Go get that. Thanks. All right. I got that little guy out. It's pretty good. All right. Good job. Because I was just avoiding drop stone. Yeah, I I've done that one too. Had to reoperate on someone. A year later. A year later.
