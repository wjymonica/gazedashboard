01:18:37,The white tissue is the safe spot for dissection.
01:18:59,Touch and confirm nothing is there; continue pushing the dissector to make the dissection.
01:19:58,Push harder.
01:21:42,Big sweep at the clip site.
01:22:09,Fat down; duct coming into view.
01:22:19,Next move: keep cleaning fat.
01:22:37,Resident dissected at the wrong place.
01:22:57,Get more tissue and be more aggressive.
01:23:50,Risk in proceeding because the structure is not clear.
01:24:41,Duct shape is clear; clean the surrounding fat.
01:24:47,Dissection based on recognizing the artery—keep that in mind.
01:25:33,Switch to skeletonize the artery.
01:25:56,Rotate tool slightly downward so both jaws/tips contact tissue for friction and effective dissection.
01:26:39,Bleeding noted; cause uncertain.
01:27:03,Anatomy is confusing—recognizing base vs. gallbladder.
01:27:32,Dissect at a higher position.
01:28:41,Brian suggests going up.
01:30:11,Brian suggests skeletonizing the duct next.
01:32:16,Two holes in the fat; start with the upper one.
01:32:51,"Sequence: push in, rotate, sweep."
01:33:21,Be careful—there might be something in the fat.
01:33:31,They decide there is nothing in the fat.
01:35:20,Predict hepatic arteries are behind.
01:35:39,Ask Leah to take off the node.
01:35:52,Artery is done.
01:38:14,"The node was vascular, causing bleeding."
01:38:58,Spread on both sides of the cystic artery with Maryland; fully expose its length to confirm you're not at the base.
01:41:43,Keep instrument perpendicular to vessel/duct axis; rotate or curl to match orientation.
01:43:35,Adjust left hand.
01:45:30,See the next dissection goal.
01:45:56,Recognize hidden artery.
01:48:44,Make an anatomy guess.
01:49:40,Might be bleeding based on experience.
01:50:39,Unknown band appears; work below it.
01:51:21,Ripping may cause bleeding.
01:51:51,"If structure unknown, pull with tool to check."
01:52:38,"For unknown structures, grab gently."
01:54:47,Anatomy is confusing—nothing or vessel?
01:55:12,Clean fat around the unknown structure first.
01:55:44,Structure now feels pulsing.
01:58:29,Hands are too high.
01:58:58,Brian takes over; starts with easier structures.
02:01:27,"After dissecting the back of the gallbladder, unknown structure seen connected to gallbladder."
02:02:31,Slide down clips when applying.
02:02:49,Move clips up and visualize clip tips.
02:08:21,"If a clip is misoriented, remove and reload it."
02:09:35,"A 30° instrument rotation changes the approach angle by ~60°, misaligning the clip."
